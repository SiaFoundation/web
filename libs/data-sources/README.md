# Data Sources

Data sources provide APIs for pulling data from SiaStats, GitHub, and internal benchmarks. The library also provides a request counter system used for tracking download counts for new Sia releases.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test data-sources` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).
