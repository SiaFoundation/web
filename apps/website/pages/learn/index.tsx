                    The Sia software divides files into dozens of shards, each
                    destined for storage on a different host. This prevents any
                    single host from holding your data hostage, and accelerates
                    transfer speeds by connecting to multiple hosts
                    simultaneously. File shards are created using a technology

                    30 shards can be used to recover the original data. This
                    means that files on Sia can remain accessible even if 20 out

                    Using the Sia blockchain, renters form file contracts with

                    Furthermore, most contracts require the host to lock up some
                    of their own siacoins as collateral, giving them a strong
                    incentive to stay online and fulfill the terms of the

                    Renters prepay for storage within file contracts, setting
                    aside a fixed amount of Siacoin to be spent on storing and
                    transferring data. File contracts typically last 90 days.
                    The renter software automatically renews contracts when they
                    are within a certain window of expiring. If contracts are
                    not renewed, any unused siacoins are returned to the renter.

                    At the end of a file contract, the host must prove that they
                    are still storing the renter's data. They do this by
                    broadcasting a storage proof transaction. If the storage
                    proof appears on the blockchain within a certain timeframe,
                    the host receives the contract payout. If not, the host
                    receives nothing, and loses any collateral that they paid
