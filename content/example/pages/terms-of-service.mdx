The Site source code is open source and publicly available on GitHub under an MIT software license.

## V. Revocation or Suspension of Use Privileges

We reserve the right at any time to terminate or suspend your use of some or all of the Website if you engage in activities that we conclude, in our discretion, breach our Website Code of Conduct.

## VI. Third-Party Links

The Website may contain links to third-party websites and services or display advertisements for third parties (collectively, "Third-Party Links"). Such Third-Party Links are not under the control of the Foundation, and the Foundation is not responsible for any Third-Party Links or for any content, opinions, or materials available on the related third party websites. The Foundation provides access to these Third-Party Links only as a convenience to you and does not review, approve, monitor, endorse, warrant, or make any representations with respect to Third-Party Links, nor does the Foundation warrant that a third party site will be free of computer viruses or other harmful code that can impact your computer or other Web-access device. You use all Third-Party Links at your own risk, and you should apply a suitable level of caution and discretion in doing so. When you click on any of the Third-Party Links, the applicable third party's terms and policies apply, including the third party's privacy and data gathering practices. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any transaction in connection with such Third-Party Links.

## VII. Warranty Disclaimer

The Foundation does not promise that the Website will be error-free or uninterrupted, that the programs, services, and features offered on our Site will be provided error-free or uninterrupted, that defects or errors will be corrected, or that the Site and/or the server that makes it available are free from viruses or other harmful component. Furthermore, the Foundation will not be responsible for any losses, damages or claims arising from events falling within the scope of the following five categories:

1. Mistakes made by the user during the use of any Sia-related software or service, e.g., forgotten passwords, payments sent to wrong Siacoin addresses, and accidental deletion of wallets.
2. Software problems during the use of the Website and/or any Sia-related software or service, e.g., corrupted wallet file, incorrectly constructed transactions, unsafe cryptographic libraries, malware affecting the Website and/or any Sia-related software or service.
3. Technical failures in the hardware of the user during the use of any Sia-related software or service, e.g., data loss due to a faulty or damaged storage device.
4. Security problems experienced by the user during the use of any Sia-related software or service, e.g., unauthorized access to users' wallets and/or accounts.

YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT USE OF THE WEBSITE, SIA-RELATED SOFTWARE, AND SIA-RELATED SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.

## VIII. Siacoin and the Website

The Website does not store, send or receive Siacoin. This is because Siacoin exists only by virtue of the ownership record maintained in the Sia network. Any transfer of title in Siacoin occurs within the decentralized Sia network, and not on the Website.

## IX. Modification to the Website and These Terms

The Foundation reserves the right, at any time, to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Website (in whole or in part) with or without notice to you. You agree that the Foundation will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Website or any part thereof. If we modify these Terms, any such modifications will take effect proactively, upon your subsequent access to the Website. Please feel free to print out a copy of these Terms for your records.

## X. Limitation of Liability

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT, OR NEGLIGENCE, WILL THE FOUNDATION (WHICH INCLUDES, FOR PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, ITS AFFILIATES, CONTRACTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OR THIRD-PARTY PARTNERS OR SUPPLIERS) BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, RELIANCE, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS) THAT ARISE OUT OF, OR ARE RELATED TO, YOUR USE OF THE SITE, SIA-RELATED SOFTWARE, SIA-RELATED SERVICES, AND/OR CONTENT CONTAINED ON THE SITE, WHETHER THE MATERIALS CONTAINED ON THE SITE ARE PROVIDED BY THE FOUNDATION OR BY A THIRD PARTY, AND EVEN IF THE FOUNDATION OR A FOUNDATION AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. YOU AGREE THAT THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION WILL SURVIVE ANY TERMINATION OR EXPIRATION OF THIS AGREEMENT AND, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY SPECIFIED HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE FOUNDATION’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY LOSS, DAMAGE, OR CLAIM RELATED TO OR ARISING OUT OF THE SITE, SIA-RELATED SOFTWARE, SIA-RELATED SERVICES, OR ANY PROGRAMS OR SERVICES YOU RECEIVE FROM THE SITE EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNTS, IF ANY, ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU TO THE FOUNDATION FOR SUCH SITE PROGRAMS OR SERVICES DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY OR FIFTY DOLLARS, WHICHEVER IS GREATER. YOU AGREE THAT WE WOULD NOT ENTER INTO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS WITHOUT THESE LIMITATIONS ON OUR LIABILITY.

## XI. Indemnity

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold the Foundation and its subsidiaries, affiliates, licensors, services providers, and its and their respective officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, licensors, suppliers, successors and assigns, harmless from and against any and all claims, suits, actions, damage, loss, cost, expense or liability, including attorneys’ fees, relating to, arising from or as a result of your use of the Site, and/or your breach of these Terms. You agree to pay any costs, including reasonable attorney’s fees, incurred by the Foundation to enforce these Terms and Conditions.

## XII. Device Connection

Use of the Site will require your device(s) to have access or connection via mobile network or Internet (fees may apply). Because use of the Site involves hardware, software and Internet access, your ability to use the Site may be affected by the performance of these factors. The Foundation does not guarantee that this Site can be accessed on all devices. The Foundation does not guarantee that this Site is available in all geographic locations. By accepting these terms and conditions, you acknowledge and agree that complying with such system requirements, which may be changed from time to time, is your responsibility and that your use of any third-party services are subject to the terms and conditions of use established by the respective third-party service providers.

## XIII. Assignment

These Terms shall not be assignable by you, either in whole or in part. The Foundation reserves the right to assign its rights and obligations under these Terms.

## XIV. Governing Law; Jurisdiction

1. These Terms of Service have been made and shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the United States of America and the State of Massachusetts as an agreement wholly performed therein without regard to their conflict of law provisions and the United Nations Conventions on Contracts (if applicable).
2. Any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Services or these Terms of Services must be filed within one year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. Any claim by you that may arise in connection with these Terms of Service will be compensable by monetary damages and you will in no event be entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief.
3. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be removed to the extent necessary to comply with the law, replaced by a provision that most closely approximates the original intent and economic effect of the original to the extent consistent with the law, and the remaining provisions will remain in full force. Headings are for reference purposes only and in no way define, limit, construe, or describe the scope or extent of such section.
4. The Foundation’s failure to act, and/or delay in acting, with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive its right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right or power hereunder preclude further exercise of any other right hereunder.

## XV. Waiver of Class Actions; Arbitration

1. **Binding Arbitration.** You and the Foundation acknowledge that any statutory or common law claims related to intellectual property may require forms of equitable relief that are best administered by courts; accordingly, you and the Foundation agree that, except for i) statutory or common law claims related to intellectual property, and ii) any claims that may be brought in small claims court where the amount in controversy is properly within the jurisdiction of such court (collectively, “Excluded Claims”), any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Terms of Service, your relationship to the Foundation, or your use of any the Website, Sia-related software, or Sia-related services, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory (the “Covered Claims”), will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration. YOUR AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATION MEANS THAT FOR ALL COVERED CLAIMS, YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY. INSTEAD, YOU WILL HAVE A HEARING BEFORE A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR.
2. **WAIVER OF CLASS ACTIONS**. YOU AND THE FOUNDATION AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING DISPUTES RELATING TO BOTH COVERED CLAIMS AND EXCLUDED CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, A FEDERAL OR STATE CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR A CLASS ARBITRATION.
3. **Conduct of Arbitration; Governing Rules.** Arbitrations for any disputes between us relating to the Covered Claims will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with its Consumer Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Rules for Multiple Case Filings (collectively, the “AAA Rules”). For more information about arbitration, the AAA and the arbitration process, please consult the American Arbitration Association web site at adr.org. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope, application, and enforceability of the arbitration provision–including whether any claims are Covered Claims or Excluded Claims within the meaning of this provision–are for the court to decide. As stated in Section XIV, Massachusetts law applies to any arbitration under this section, but the parties acknowledge that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This arbitration agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and, if the law allows, they can seek relief against us for you.

Prior to initiating arbitration for a Covered Claim, both parties agree that they will provide individualized written notice of the potential claim to the opposing party setting forth (i) the factual and legal basis for the claim; (ii) contact information for the potential claimant and their counsel, if any; and (iii) the remedies sought, including the amount of claimed monetary damages (the “Notice”).  Following receipt of the Notice by the opposing party, the parties agree to make a good faith effort for at least 30 days to resolve the claim before resorting to more formal means of resolution, including, without limitation, arbitration or any court action. To provide notice of a claim to the Foundation, write to [info@sia.tech](mailto:info@sia.tech).

Unless you and the Foundation agree otherwise in writing, any hearings for the arbitration will take place in a location to be determined in accordance with the AAA Rules.  Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules, except that if the arbitrator finds at any time that a claim was filed frivolously, for purposes of harassment, or otherwise in bad faith, then the filing party will reimburse the other party for all costs and fees, including attorneys’ fees, associated with that claim.

Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any federal or state court of competent jurisdiction located in the County of Suffolk in the State of Massachusetts. The arbitrator may award money or equitable relief in favor of only the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. To reduce the time and expense of the arbitration, the arbitrator will not provide a statement of reasons for his or her award unless requested to do so by both parties.

For all litigation regarding Excluded Claims and any other controversy or claim for which arbitration is denied, the sole jurisdiction and venue for such litigation will be an appropriate federal or state court located in the County of Suffolk in the State of Massachusetts.

All provisions of this Dispute Resolution – Arbitration and Waiver of Class Actions Section shall survive termination of these Terms of Service and the Terms of Sale, your relationship with us, and/or your account or profile.
