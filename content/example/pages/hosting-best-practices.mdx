# Introduction

Sia is a decentralized cloud storage platform. Instead of renting storage from a centralized provider, peers on Sia rent storage from each other. On the Sia network, we refer to these peers as “Hosts” and “Renters.” We believe decentralization allows the Sia network to offer benefits to both Hosts and Renters not provided by traditional centralized storage providers. At their core, these benefits provide greater choices over how data is stored. For Hosts this ultimately means the opportunity for more control over how you engage with renters and store data. For Renters, this presents an opportunity for more control over your data and how it is stored

Decentralization means that the Sia network has no central server or authority that controls the network. Instead, Sia Hosts and Renters running the Sia network software are the network. Sia Hosts and Renters may be located anywhere in the world. This means the laws, rules, or regulations applicable to a Host or Renter in one location may not apply to a Host or Renter in another location. Given the breadth of the Sia network, and the myriad different locations of Hosts and Renters, it is not possible for Sia to identify all of these laws, much less to give any legal advice regarding whether particular activity may be permitted under any specific law. Addressing these requirements is the obligation of Hosts and Renters.

The Sia Foundation has, however, prepared this document to provide high level guidance for using the Sia network. Our goal in doing so is not to provide legal advice, but to establish a set of common best practices for Hosts to help ensure the continued efficient functioning of the Sia network and to enable Hosts and Renters alike to continue to realize its benefits. Sia suggests that all Hosts know and follow these best practices. Please also check back to review these best practices, as we may update them from time to time.

# Best Practices

## Sia’s Role

Sia provides the Sia network software. It does not provide the Sia network itself. Hosts, Renters, and others running the Sia network software make up the Sia network. Anyone can download the Sia network software and become a Host or Renter. Sia does not control Hosts or Renters and, in fact, in almost all cases Sia has no means to identify Hosts or Renters, other than via IP address. As a Host, you operate independently. Sia cannot act on behalf of Hosts, nor is Sia in a position to offer Hosts assistance in their dealings with Renters.

## Storage Contracts

When a Host agrees to store data for a Renter, the Host and Renter enter into a smart contract defining the amount of data stored, for how long, at what price, and the other terms of their arrangement. Sia is not a party to these smart contracts formed between Host and Renter. Rather, Hosts and Renters engage directly with each other as peers on the Sia network. As a Host, you are responsible for setting the terms of each storage contract you enter into with a Renter and fulfilling the requirements of that contract.

## Information Provided to Renters

Hosts are expected to provide true and accurate information to Renters. When announcing and advertising themselves to Renters, Hosts must not provide information that is false, deceptive, or misleading. Hosts are responsible for ensuring that the information they provide to Renters remains updated and accurate. Hosts must not seek to deceive Renters regarding the storage services they provide or the level or quality of those services.

## Disagreements with Renters

Hosts are responsible for resolving any disagreements or other issues directly with Renters. Sia cannot be asked to act on behalf of Hosts or Renters or to assist in resolving disagreements or other issues. Sia will not be responsible for the occurrence of disagreements or other issues that may arise between Hosts or Renters, nor their resolution.

## Legal Compliance

Sia is not responsible for the actions of any member of the Sia community, whether Host or Renter. Each member of the Sia community is responsible for its own actions, and for ensuring that its actions comply with applicable laws and do not cause Sia or any other member of the Sia community to violate applicable laws.

## Court Orders and other Legal and Governmental Requirements

Court orders, subpoenas, warrants, and other legal or governmental requirements to provide information or take action vary by location, with each governed by different laws and dependent on different facts. While these types of legal requirements are generally infrequent, they should not be ignored. Should a Host receive such a court order, subpoena, warrant, and other type of legal or governmental requirement, we recommend consulting legal counsel.

## Providing Renter Identity Information and/or Files to Third Parties

Hosts should also not normally have access to information about the identity of Renters, other than their IP address. However, if a Renter’s identity becomes known to a Host, the Host should not disclose that information (or the IP address) to any third party absent a legal requirement to do so (such as a court order, subpoena, or warrant). Nor should a Host provide information about Renter files, or the contents of those files themselves, to third parties, again unless legally required to do so.

## Access to Renter Files

Whether encrypted or unencrypted, Hosts should not take any affirmative action to access or view Renter files – or information about those files – stored on their servers, except as necessary to accomplish the transmission, protection, or storage of those files. The same holds true for Renter files while they are in transit to or from a Host’s server. In other words, with respect to the contents of files and their accompanying metadata, Hosts should limit their activities to hosting.

## Encryption of Renter Files

Sia encourages Renters to encrypt their files. However, Hosts should be aware that Renters may choose not to do so.

## Host Systems

Each Host is entirely responsible for the systems it uses to provide storage to Renters. Hosts are expected to operate and maintain their systems at a high quality of service and in accordance with all standards advertised to Renters and agreed upon in any storage contract.

## Host Security

Host systems are vulnerable to denial of service attacks and other external threats which could prevent Hosts from fulfilling the terms of their storage contracts. It is the responsibility of each Host to maintain reasonable security measures designed to protect its systems from such threats.

## Renter Data

Due to the potential for liability, including from data security threats and obligations under applicable law, Hosts may wish to consider what types of data they will refuse to store. For example, Hosts may choose to refuse the storage of personal information or other sensitive information by Renters. However, Hosts should be aware that this may limit the market of Renters that will choose to rent with the Host.
