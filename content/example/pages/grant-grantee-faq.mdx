# Approved Grantee FAQ

## Post-approval

If approved, you’re all set! You’ll then move on to our Post Approval process, which includes communicating with our operations team to complete the paperwork associated with your grant in compliance with United States Law.

If conditionally approved, you’re good to go as long as you commit to making our recommended changes. The committee will communicate further with you during the Post Approval process.

## Payments

Grants are only offered in SC and USD/other fiat at this time. For grants with a timeline of 1 or more years, payments will be made quarterly. For grants with a timeline of less than 1 year, payments will be made monthly. Grant payments are made the 15th of every month. Please note that it may take a few days for payments to be received.

## Reports

**When are they due?**

- Monthly reports are due the 2nd of every month after your grant has been approved.

**What do I need to put in the report?**

- The report should state a summary of your progress over the past month. Please also include links to code if any.

**Where do I submit the progress?**

- On the forum where your proposal was submitted, just add a comment.

## Post Grant

**I need more money to complete my grant, what do I do?**

- If you’re still within your original grant period but funds have run dry, you can request additional funds. The committee will review this request and recommend approval or rejection.

If you’ve completed your project and wish to continue working under a grant, you can submit a new proposal for committee review.
