Skynet will remain online.</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Qb2ylwebgLLlvo0iQoTyZw.png" /></figure><p>It is with regret that we announce Skynet Labs has been unable to complete its next round of fundraising and will be shutting down. Thankfully, Skynet as a platform will be able to continue operating: all user files will remain online and key portions of the infrastructure will continue to be actively developed. Unfortunately, Skynet will have to continue without Skynet Labs and without many of the amazing people who have put their heart and soul into building a brighter future for users and user data.</p><p>Much of what Skynet has accomplished, including its ability to continue operating in the face of Skynet Lab’s dissolution, and including its ability to provide value to the wider web3 ecosystem, is owed to the efforts and contributions of the Skynet Labs team members. It is with great sadness that we will be letting the members of our team go, even though we have every need for and appreciation of their efforts.</p><p><strong>Read the full announcement to the Skynet community including what to expect next on </strong><a href="https://siasky.net/FAD8MqXHfRSbFXdZpQhw4Q09_ZWP2a-miEchmm0VUSzDUA"><strong>Siasky.net</strong></a><strong> or </strong><a href="https://skynetfree.net/FAD8MqXHfRSbFXdZpQhw4Q09_ZWP2a-miEchmm0VUSzDUA"><strong>Skynetfree.net</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=5397184e214d" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://blog.sia.tech/skynet-labs-is-shutting-down-skynet-remains-online-5397184e214d">Skynet Labs is shutting down.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*FYnTJZXVPZ1JjIxyodujQQ.png" /></figure><p>Long overdue, but I’m happy to present the latest update for Skynet’s roadmap. Our <a href="https://blog.sia.tech/the-worrying-depth-and-scope-of-censorship-on-the-internet-ffd4bc5a5486">recent chaos</a> has caused us to reconsider what technology decisions are acceptable, and what it takes to build a robust platform that meets user expectations for decentralization.</p><h3>Fluid Skynet Portals</h3><p>It has become clear to us that we cannot use portals as a stable piece of infrastructure. The original idea behind portals was to make them a trusted, centralized infrastructure, but allow users to easily switch between portals in the event that a portal went offline. Users would have to find trustworthy portals but would have no exposure to vendor lock-in.</p><p>This original model was (and still is) several steps ahead of most web3 providers. Major infrastructure providers like Infura and Open Sea are both closed source and difficult to operate. Skynet portals on the other hand are open source and readily swapped out from each other.</p><p>The challenges with the original model were nonetheless significant. Users on different portals had difficulties sharing files with each other because files uploaded to one portal had a completely different URL than files to another portal. Retrieving files from a different portal required making changes to the URL, which is not difficult but is inconvenient.</p><p>The UX annoyances surrounding Skynet portals become more pronounced when we started experiencing regular deplatformings. Siasky became unstable, and even users who were using a common portal had to frequently change out the URL.</p><p>To address this, we’ve kicked off a project called the Skynet Kernel, which is a webapp plugin that automatically switches the user to their favorite portal, including being able to automatically use failovers if the user’s preferred portal is offline or otherwise unavailable. Thanks to Kernel, users can expect a reliable and consistent experience regardless of which portals they use, which portals their friends use, and which portals are currently offline.</p><p>The Skynet Kernel also means that less user education is required to get people using Skynet because Skynet overall feels significantly more like the traditional web, despite being decentralized.</p><h3>Skynet Portal APIs</h3><p>Portals on Skynet were originally, like most other web3 infrastructure, fully trusted. Users were expected to find a reliable and trustworthy portal operator and then hope that the operator did not inject malicious code while they were using Skynet.</p><p>Though this is how pretty much all of web3 works, we lost faith in the model. Especially when users are using multiple infrastructure providers and failing over between them, users need to have confidence that they are protected against all forms of malice.</p><p>We have since updated the Skynet portal APIs so that all major functions have fully verifiable endpoints. <strong>To the best of my knowledge, Skynet is the only web3 platform today that has accomplished this.</strong> Whether you are uploading files to Skynet (files of any size!), downloading files from Skynet (again, files of any size!), or using dynamic content, the portals offer cryptographic assurance that the request is being completed correctly.</p><p>The one major caveat with this upgrade is that modern web browsers do not have the ability to verify these cryptographic proofs. To get fully proper assurance that the portal is not acting maliciously, users need to install the Skynet Kernel browser extension. Even without a browser extension, we are able to significantly reduce user exposure to malice, but a user is only fully safe if they install the extension.</p><p>While the API supports all types of interactions trustlessly, the Skynet Kernel currently only supports registry actions, and small file actions (both uploads and downloads). The browser extension also does not yet support trustless webapp loading. All of these features are being developed, and we will get Skynet to the point of being fully trustless before too long.</p><h3>Skynet Portal Setup</h3><p>One critical focus for the Skynet team has been the ability for third parties to easily set up their own portals. A few months back we even had a workshop for people to set up their own portals. The workshop was nearly successful, with just a few hiccups that made a start-to-finish setup difficult for participants.</p><p>The portal stack has since gotten a bit more complicated, mostly owing to processes that we’ve had to add as a response to the turbulence of being continuously de-platformed. The portal now has more robust processes related to file repair and more robust processes related to MongoDB. Some of the health checks are also more robust.</p><p>As a result, we still haven’t yet achieved the creation of a simple workshop that can get a portal operator from zero to fully established in under 4 hours, but it has become a top priority for us and we hope to have the workshop completed within a month.</p><p>Two key upgrades since our previous workshop include switching from LastPass to Hashicorp and enabling support for text file configurations. Both upgrades should make it significantly easier for individuals to set up their own portals, and the removal of LastPass means we no longer have closed-source products as part of our portal stack.</p><p>We will reach out to the community soon with details about our next workshop — stay tuned!</p><h3>Improved Renter Stability</h3><p>Between the chaos of continuous de-platforming, the influx of new hosts, and the price turbulence on the network, the upload, download, and repair systems of the renter were put under stress. At one point, we lost user files due to our servers being fully unplugged without us having time to react.</p><p>Several bugs and instabilities have been fixed related to these systems. Downloads are now more stable and consistently fast. Uploads are also more consistently fast. Files more consistently stay in good health, and the total amount of repair required to keep a set of files online has been reduced.</p><p>One key change that we’ve made is that file repair now happens across servers as well as within a server. Prior to this enhancement, if a server got randomly ripped offline (say by an over-eager IT admin who is antsy about some phishing reports), the files that had been on that server would live for about a month before falling off the network, with no easy way to recover.</p><p>We now have a cross-server repair system that allows one server to tell if another server is no longer able to repair files. In that case, it’ll assume the responsibility and get the files up to good health. So long as a portal cluster has at least one server with operating capacity, files will not be lost from the cluster even if many of the servers are being brutally ripped offline.</p><h3>SDK Evolution</h3><p>As a part of the transition to a more fully decentralized stack, we’re beginning to transition the developer ecosystem from using skynet-js to using the libkernel and libkmodule libraries, which are part of the Skynet Kernel toolkit. At this point, both libkernel and libkmodule are still in alpha and are not recommended for fully deployed production applications. We expect to transition to beta within a few weeks, and then to v1.0 a few weeks after that. If all goes well, libkernel and libkmodule should be the default recommended libraries starting in October.</p><p>If you are familiar with the Skynet ecosystem, you know that Skynet development is broken into two major categories: webapps and <a href="https://docs.skynetlabs.com/skynet-topics/mysky-and-dacs">Data Access Controllers</a>. Previously, both types of development were done using skynet-js, which was effective but especially didn’t give DACs all of the features that they needed to be maximally useful. Furthermore, the standard for DACs was to use iframes, which had significant enough performance limitations that they really couldn’t be used in a composable way.</p><p>The new ecosystem tooling addresses this by moving DACs from iframes to web workers, where they are 10–30x faster in the naive case, and as much as 1000x faster in the optimized case. These performance boosts make composability tractable for real-time user applications. Further, DACs now have their own special library — libkmodule, which provides tooling that removes almost all of the boilerplate involved with writing DACs and allows developers to focus on the fun parts.</p><p>We’ve also updated the naming a bit. You will often now hear DACs referred to as “Kernel modules”, because Kernel modules provide substantially more functionality than the original DACs.</p><h3>The Skynet Kernel</h3><p>When computing transitioned from most applications being on the desktop to most applications being in the web browser, the user gained an enormous amount of convenience in the form of all of their data and experiences being available from every device, and all of their data surviving adventures like getting a new laptop.</p><p>This convenience came at a steep price, which is that corporations now control all of the user’s data, and the user transitions into a feudal state where they have to do things like rent the tools they use for work, and rent the music they listen to and the movies they watch. And they have to live with the fact that key parts of their lives can be taken away from them at any time.</p><p>The Skynet Kernel is a new programming paradigm that gives users all of the convenience of apps in the web browser with all of the liberty and control of running an open source desktop like Linux. It effectively allows webapps to run entirely in the client, while simultaneously having access to APIs that act like a cloud.</p><p>The Kernel is a fully trustless application environment. Every piece of code that runs is verified in full by the user, and at the user’s discretion can be swapped out with different code. All interactions with Skynet are verified cryptographically, ensuring the user can’t be lied to by the cloud. And because all of the programs run on the client, this also means that apps can’t be upgraded without the user’s permission — features that were once free can’t suddenly start charging money, because the user has the full autonomy to downgrade.</p><p>The Kernel can be used across the entire web3 ecosystem. The programming paradigm is fully generalized, which means you can use it to create trustless relays from webapps to things like the Ethereum blockchain. You can even use the Skynet kernel to inject trustless relays into centralized applications like OpenSea, allowing users to see the full list of assets even if the application itself is engaging in censorship.</p><h3>The Skynet Token Framework</h3><p>The Kernel is even powerful enough to run entire blockchains from the web browser. One of the biggest struggles of decentralized blockchains to date was figuring out how to convince everyday users to run full nodes. This problem is so difficult that most projects have entirely given up on it, and instead encourage users to depend on relays and trusted infrastructure.</p><p>We believe this problem can be solved by placing the blockchain full node directly into the browser via the Skynet Kernel. Users don’t even have to be aware that the full node is there, working in the background to verify all of their transactions. And this is exactly how the Skynet token will work. Every user will be using the blockchain from a full node.</p><p>However, the full Skynet token framework is so much more than a blockchain in the browser. It’s a means for Skynet applications to monetize without disrupting user experience. Skynet token is a micropayments platform that allows applications to charge users hundredths of a cent per page view without needing ads or consent paywalls. In one sense it’s like ERC20 on steroids, and in another sense, it’s like Patreon on steroids.</p><p>In the full design, every single user gets their own token. And every single application gets its own token. And every single piece of content released on Skynet gets its own token. That’s because on the web, contributions are provided by everyone. On Skynet, Reddit Karma isn’t just fake imaginary points, it’s monetization that pays users back for contributing meaningfully to the Internet.</p><p>The Skynet token blockchain features a large number of novel technologies, including Skynet-based block distribution, utreexo-based state management, a low power consumption proof of work algorithm, and a token framework similar to ERC20 that has no MEV. Everything has been optimized to run in the browser, ensuring that users who access Skynet exclusively from their phones are still able to enjoy the full benefits of a trustless blockchain.</p><p>Development progress for Skynet token is already well underway. We’re just a few weeks from having a fully functional in-browser blockchain featuring empty blocks. This includes support for miners, mining pools, and support for a peer-to-peer network. Once the empty-block chain is alive, we’ll be working on a wallet with support for the SKT asset (Skynet Token). And after that, we’ll finally implement and release the full token ecosystem.</p><h3>Focused on Fundamentals</h3><p>Over the past year, we’ve been quietly and persistently upgrading Skynet. We are sharply focused on two key objectives:</p><ol><li>Uncompromising decentralization</li><li>A user experience that is comparable to web2</li></ol><p>Achieving both of those things at the same time has required a substantial amount of innovation, but we are fortunate enough to have a team that is more than capable of consistently churning out new updates that push the boundaries of our industry.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=4aaf2ddf6587" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://blog.sia.tech/skynet-roadmap-and-update-summer-2022-4aaf2ddf6587">Skynet Roadmap and Update: Summer 2022</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.sia.tech">The Sia Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*LLSzMI2yoy0sRTJV.png" /></figure><p>As users are looking for a way out of the black hole and iron fist of today’s social platforms, Web3 has cast a new vision for mainstream adoption of trustless, decentralized social applications that are owned by users, instead of corporations.</p><p>Today more than ever, users are aware that centralized social platforms are putting profits and stock prices over user rights of privacy and data. This degree of trust in centralized tech is a slippery slope that enables malicious behavior from special interest groups, political parties, and rogue developers.</p><p>As users are looking for a way out of the black hole and iron fist of today’s social platforms, Web3 has cast a new vision for mainstream adoption of trustless, decentralized social applications that are owned by users, instead of corporations.</p><p>Over the past two years, Skynet has focused on building decentralized infrastructure for developers to support a new wave of web3 social dApps that put users first. Our vision is to see the next Twitter, Youtube, and Facebook be trustless applications that allow user ownership of data, identity, and social graphs. With trustless social dApps built around data interoperability, users can easily move across applications without having to risk social consequences or being locked out of features that have become integral to everyday living.</p><h3>Ownership Economy and Creator Tokens</h3><p>The rise of NFT’s in 2021 proved that the creators have a place in web3, but NFTs are just the tip of the iceberg. Web3 coined the term “Ownership Economy”, promising a new method of monetization to replace the pitfalls of advertising models. Creator Tokens are the new stocks of web3, granting users’ ownership and financial stake in the platforms they use and the communities they build.</p><p>Skynet extends the token monetization model of the ownership economy not only to content creators, but developers as well. Kernel, Skynet’s newest release will allow developers to build on decentralized and interoperable data, enabling monetization of shared code and trustless API’s saved on Skynet. This fuels sustainable innovation and platform diversity while distributing wealth among all contributors, whether you’re a content creator on a social application or a core contributor to open-sourced code.</p><h3>Developer Infrastructure for Social Applications</h3><p>Decentralized storage and infrastructure pave the way for social dApps that give control back to users. Our platform emphasizes ease of use, developer ergonomics, and matches the performance and scalability of web2 infrastructure.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Pfkgp2P-Q_9t2640iUX7Fw.png" /></figure><p>Just as everyone is getting used to the new world of web3, it’s time to introduce a new technology: <strong>web5</strong>. It’s confusing and unfortunate, but it’s the name that’s been chosen and it has a real vision behind it that’s worth paying attention to.</p><p>Web3 is a catch-all term for anything cryptocurrency. And while cryptocurrency used to imply ideals of decentralization and user ownership, today it covers an ocean of projects and financial innovations, and no longer has a strong central narrative beyond ‘innovative digital objects of value’. The heavy dilution of the web3 narrative has created a vision gap that web5 has come to replace.</p><p>Web5 is specifically focused on users, their identity, their data, and the idea that we can build large-scale applications such that users have control rather than corporations. For web5, cryptocurrency is a background element — it’s useful sometimes, but it’s just a tool and not a core principle or driving reason to exist.</p><p>Web5 couldn’t come at a better time. Users are more aware than ever that they do not control their online presence and they do not control their online future.</p><p>This was underscored recently by Elon Musk’s bid to acquire Twitter. By throwing around tens of billions of dollars, Elon Musk demonstrated that he has the power to take unilateral control of a platform that has enormous influence over the global political landscape.</p><p>The hidden Twitter story though is the people and communities that use and depend on Twitter every day. The majority of the value of Twitter is not created by people on Twitter’s payroll, but by unpaid users who have spent an enormous amount of effort building up their online presence, which includes both their social graph and also their persona.</p><p>Because of this, acquiring Twitter is different than acquiring something like a laptop company, a restaurant, or a movie studio. For traditional companies, most of the value is created by the company (or people who are getting paid by the company), and most of the effort involved in delivering the end product comes from the company itself. The consumer’s burden in buying and consuming the product is a fraction of the total effort that went into creating the product.</p><p>Twitter is less like a traditional company and more like a small nation or government. In order to use Twitter, you have to put material effort into growing your social network. Furthermore, this effort is entirely non-transferable. If you decide that you don’t like Twitter’s policies or terms of service, your only recourse is to abandon your friends and followers and start from scratch on a new platform.</p><p>If Twitter were a grocery store, it would be a grocery store where the shoppers themselves planted all the trees, tended to all the animals, and the only compensation the shoppers receive is the ability to consume the food that they grew themselves — they aren’t even allowed to consume the food produced by other shoppers! If some new rule appears (like “Twitter is now for vegan food only!), the shoppers’ only recourse is to start over with seeds and baby animals in a new grocery store.</p><p>Twitter of course is just one example. These dynamics are at play on every major social platform — Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, Twitch, Snapchat, Discord, and so on — all of these platforms are platforms where the majority of value is created by the users rather than the companies, and all the users of these platforms cannot easily switch to a new platform if new or unwanted policies are introduced.</p><p>Perhaps the most brutal example is the sale of WhatsApp to Facebook. Prior to its acquisition, WhatsApp was a world leader in privacy and encryption. Users chose WhatsApp in part because of the security and privacy it offered, and they put a great amount of effort into pulling their family and friends on this privacy-first network. After the acquisition, the story changed to “give all of your private information and data to Facebook or you will not be able to speak to your grandmother anymore”. Again, social networks are more like nations and governments than they are like traditional companies that sell products.</p><h3>So where does Web5 fit into this?</h3><p>Web5 is a bleeding edge class of technology that’s aimed at solving this problem for social media. And specifically, web5 wants to solve this problem by putting the data in the hands of users, rather than having the data owned by the corporations.</p><p>Web5 goes a step further than just governance. The governance solution would insist that users need to vote and consent to any change of power like a transfer from the WhatsApp company to the Facebook company, or a transfer from the Twitter board of directors to Elon Musk. The web5 solution insists that social media platforms should be commoditized, and just as shoppers could switch from grocery store to grocery store, users should be able to switch between Twitter and TikTok with the same ease (and without losing their followers or friends)</p><p>If web5 is successful, events like Elon Musk acquiring Twitter lose much of their societal implication. In a web2 world, when Elon Musk owns Twitter, he captures users who have little alternative or ability to switch away. In a web5 world, he gains an audience, but it’s an audience that has the full freedom to leave for greener pastures if they decide that Elon’s changes are unfavorable.</p><p>Web5’s goals are ambitious. The entire Internet was built around the idea that the server owns and controls all of the data, and that the users trust and depend on the server. For user’s to own the data, several dramatic shifts are needed in the way web applications are built.</p><p>In many ways, the biggest problem is identity. And while identity is traditionally thought of as a set of credentials that you use to prove yourself, your online identity is actually useless if it’s not also accompanied by all of your data. And by “your data” we don’t just mean your files on DropBox. We mean the list of friends you have, your message history, all of the music playlists you’ve created, all the videos you’ve liked — every piece of data that’s required from users to build a modern web application is a part of your online identity.</p><p><strong>Web5 solves this problem with decentralized storage.</strong> All of a user’s data is stored in a decentralized cloud where the public data (such as blog posts, social media videos, etc) can be accessed by anyone, and the private data (such as personal photos, download history, etc) can only be accessed by properly authorized parties.</p><p><strong>Central to the idea of decentralized storage is also decentralized certification/authentication.</strong> When you are reading data from a user, you want to be able to verify that the data was actually published by that user. This is typically an easy problem to solve once you have decentralized storage — wherever you are storing the data, you can also store a signature that authenticates the data. These signatures make data re-hostable; data published by one user can be stored and distributed by any arbitrary third party, and users who fetch the data from a third party can still be confident that it the correct original data.</p><p><strong>The other major problem facing Web5 is compatibility.</strong> If you want users to easily migrate between platforms while retaining their data and connections to other users, you need data to be interoperable. Different applications need to use compatible formats for their data.</p><p>Most Web5 projects address the compatibility challenge with a concept known as “schemas”<strong>.</strong> The general idea behind a schema is that you formally define a specification for a specific type of data and expect everyone to adhere perfectly to that specification. Every new type of data needs a new schema, and every application developer needs to learn all of the schemas of any data that they wish to be compatible with.</p><h3>Web5 Data Schemes Versus Skynet Modules</h3><p>At Skynet Labs, we found the idea of schemas to be incredibly cumbersome and came up with an alternative solution called “modules”. Modules share data by creating APIs rather than schemas, and mimic the way that most of the Internet shares data today. The APIs run locally in webworkers rather than on remote servers, making them decentralized. Otherwise, they create and manage data in much of the same way that traditional websites create and manage data. This approach allows for:</p><ul><li>Rapid development</li><li>More flexibility in introducing changes or upgrades to data formats</li><li>Substantially reduces the total coordination required between different developers to share data</li></ul><p>While Web5 is the new kid on the block (no pun intended) with funding and Jack Dorsey’s name behind it, a lot of the old players in the web3 space and building under the same principles that web5 proposes.</p><p>Skynet Labs, my own company, has been working on Web5 ideas and building a community of developers for 2.5 years now. Our platform emphasizes ease of use, developer ergonomics, and matching the performance and scalability of web2 platforms.</p><p>The other two major players in the space are Dat/Hypercore and Ceramic. While some might include IPFS as a player too, IPFS is more narrowly focused on infrastructure and has not done as much to solve the challenges surrounding identity and data interoperability.. (Typically when you think Web5 + IPFS, you think Ceramic).</p><p>Each of the major web5 players has a slightly different approach, but we’re all working towards the same goal — give control of the Internet back to the users. We all agree that the Internet is in bad shape, and we would all like to return to the open data archive that used to exist. We also all believe that it’s possible, and that an Internet with open data under the Web5 ideals will be more innovative and more beneficial to humanity than the Internet we have today.</p><p>If you would like to learn more or even join the fight to take back the Internet, come visit our discord at <a href="https://discord.gg/skynetlabs">https://discord.gg/skynetlabs</a></p><p>For extra web5 content, watch our Twitter Spaces that we hosted!</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FnzQK3ixyXP0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DnzQK3ixyXP0&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FnzQK3ixyXP0%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/232d12ae3a22b8fd5198ff39d3cde847/href">https://medium.com/media/232d12ae3a22b8fd5198ff39d3cde847/href</a></iframe><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=6c60c8056732" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://blog.sia.tech/decentralized-identity-and-web5-explained-6c60c8056732">Decentralized Identity and “Web5” Explained</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.sia.tech">The Sia Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*7-Xsv4eJ8L_P6GwMYEp5vQ.png" /></figure><h3>Local Data Storage 101</h3><p>Storing data, like many topics, is best explained through analogies. So let’s use the analogy of humans storing themselves at night, or as some might call it, sleeping 🛌. When we store ourselves for the night, we put ourselves in our bed; or rather, “store ourselves locally”.</p><p>For data storage, when we want to save data, the bytes of information are saved to a computer’s hard drive. When you save data on your laptop, you are storing data locally.</p><h3>Cloud Storage 101</h3><p>As the travel industry grew, the need to store ourselves somewhere else grew too. The solution was hotels.</p><p>Similarly, as the internet grew, the need to store data somewhere else grew. Relying just on local data storage for growing enterprises meant expanding office spaces and dedicating significant resources to IT closets that hosted hundreds of computers and specialty servers. Managing IT resources burdened enterprises that were looking to scale fast with flexibility.</p><p>The solution was <em>the cloud</em> ☁️.</p><p>The majority of applications today store data in the cloud, which is simply a rented computer that allows you to save data or spin up applications quickly without being stuck with permanent IT infrastructure that might just be needed for a short-term project.</p><p>Today, cloud server providers such as Google and Amazon Web Services have hundreds of thousands of servers lined on metal racks in warehouses all across the world, utilizing every server as a hotel room for your data.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/300/0*QoAvsHjnyooBNIB4.jpeg" /></figure><h3>Decentralized Storage</h3><p>As the travel industry continued to grow, we saw the rise of major hotel chains that dominated the market share by building larger properties in every city and squashing local competition. This created very few options when visiting a new city, and the lack of options created a lack of control. What if hotels decided to triple the price of a room overnight, steal your belongings, or tear down local spots to expand their hotels even more? As a solution to this, Airbnb created a decentralized human storage network by allowing anyone to be a hotel. This creates more choice and a better experience when storing yourself. Want to rent someone’s extra bedroom for a quick trip into town, or a mansion for your next college reunion?</p><p>Maybe you want to be a digital nomad and rent out your place for passive income while you travel. Decentralizing the hotel industry gives choice and power back to both renters and hosts alike. Just like the hotel industry, data storage has followed a similar path. A few key players such as AWS and Google Cloud Services have grown to dominate the industry, squashing our competitors and locking in users to features with few other options.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*5QO8aObsHbqlW71U.jpeg" /></figure><p>Like we’ve mentioned before, Lack of options = Lack of control. Skynet Labs gives control back to users by making decentralized storage available to everyone, whether you want to use decentralized storage as a personal backup or to deploy a dApp on decentralized storage.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*K-h13LyJUMHbyk14uZE_3A.png" /></figure><p>I’ve spent the past two years of my life trying to stand up a platform where people can share data. Our team is frustrated by the current state of the internet, where data lives in silos and user activities are strictly locked to a single platform. We’re trying to build an alternative where core concepts like a user’s social graph and content feed can follow them from platform to platform, and any developer can build new infrastructure that leverages all of a user’s existing data.</p><p>And while that journey is going well overall, we’ve hit some eye-opening barricades when it comes to managing the content on our platform. Censorship on the Internet happens at every layer, including layers most people don’t even realize exist. Our website has been censored by our hosting providers, by platforms like Twitter, by search engines like Google, and we’ve even been censored by the Chrome browser itself.</p><p>My goal today is to walk you through all of the layers of censorship that exist on the web. Most people don’t realize just how many different actors are involved in keeping a website available to the public, nor do they realize just how many of these actors can independently decide that a particular website should no longer exist.</p><h3>Gone with a Bang</h3><p>Our story starts in May 2020, when one day our website suddenly vanished.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*M0WpUo9Zf97i0LA63w2hvg.png" /></figure><p>Our first round of debugging came up completely empty. Cloudflare was configured correctly, community members on numerous continents confirmed the outage, the server was up and responding, and all services were locally reporting healthy. But most importantly, the outage wasn’t some sort of 504 or ‘server is busy’ message. The browser was acting like nobody had registered that domain at all.</p><p>We contacted Namecheap and discovered that they had forcibly unregistered our domain because we had been accused of phishing fraud. And upon further inspection, we realized that one of our own partners had issued the abuse complaint that led to our removal.</p><p>Without going too deeply into the weeds, we had been working with Uniswap to host an <a href="https://siasky.net/EAByx9EagK71BoS1za93Q9s0l7xSe7VG6P8aUEtJK4mmDQ/build/index.html">authentic clone</a> of their application on our website. Uniswap’s anti-phishing team had found our clone and mistaken it for a common phishing scam, and thus had asked Namecheap to take our website offline.</p><p>We talked to both Namecheap and Uniswap, worked through the mistake, and got our website back online. Our first brush with censorship had been brutally user-facing, but appeared to be an honest mistake. We set up better abuse reporting flows, wrote some spicy Twitter threads, and went back to business as usual. We figured that since we now had better communication with our domain registrar, censorship wasn’t likely to happen again.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/512/1*7qlskLGWCN8RNEMbnaLbvw.jpeg" /></figure><h3>US-East is Dead</h3><p>Things were okay for about a month, at which point we received another round of reports that our website was down. This time, instead of being completely gone we were just getting a standard ‘server not found’ message, and it was only happening in our US-East region. We tried to ssh into our US-East servers and found that they were… not there.</p><p>It turns out that our US hosting provider — IONOS — had frozen our servers and our account for abuse. The complaint was once again for phishing, and this time the offending website appeared to be a genuine website that was phishing users for their… IONOS credentials. Unsurprisingly, IONOS was not amused. And unlike Namecheap, they didn’t give our servers back after we had blocked the bad guys and disabled the phishing website.</p><p>We stabilized by re-routing US-East to the EU region. This had a latency penalty, but at least ensured uptime for our US customers. We later found a new US hosting provider and migrated everything over. And while the overall impact for our users was small, the impact for our team was more pronounced.</p><p>This was the first point where we started to wonder if we were in over our heads. We had been running our website for all of four months and were now dealing with abuse complaints and de-platforming on multiple fronts. And unlike our previous adventure with censorship, the abuse this time appeared to be legitimate. It seemed like things would be getting worse before they would be getting better.</p><h3>Freedom of Speech</h3><p>Our website is just infrastructure. If you are unfamiliar with what we do, we build a peer-to-peer network that allows people to share files and data with each other. And when I say ‘files and data’, I mean much more than Linux ISOs and photo albums. We mean “data” in the big tech sense — a user’s social graph, the feed of comments on a video, the algorithms that help build a user’s content feed. We’re trying to re-write the foundation of the Internet.</p><p>Our website is a convenient portal to access this data. When you load an application like Uniswap on our website, our server isn’t hosting the application code. The application code is being delivered from the Sia network. When we “block” something on our website, we aren’t taking it offline, we’re just refusing to fetch that data from the Sia network.</p><p>This makes content management a lot more difficult for us than for a platform like Imgur or Github. When a user requests a file or application, there’s a good chance that none of our servers have ever seen that data before — we don’t know if it’s malicious. And because our website can be used to load entire applications, we also have no built-in mechanism that can be used to report abusive content; we don’t control the UI that is presented to our users.</p><p>On the whole, we believe that this is a good thing for freedom of speech. We believe that anyone should be able to publish a website to the Internet. We believe that anybody should be able to share files with friends and that you shouldn’t need to identify yourself to a corporation or have your data scanned and reviewed before you are allowed to put it out into the world.</p><p>For those reasons, we decided after the IONOS event that we were only going to block content from our website (sometimes called a portal) if people sent us abuse reports.</p><h3>Chrome</h3><p>I don’t think we even made it a full month before this policy got thrown in our face. This time the problem wasn’t phishing, it was malware. And the catalyst wasn’t one of our infrastructure providers, it was Google Chrome.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/879/1*oM21sFycY4rJzWRYeEJ_RQ.png" /></figure><p>In a single update, 2 billion users worldwide were simultaneously blocked from accessing our website. When we went to Google for help, they explained that we had malware on our website. They provided a sample set of links that contained malware, then stated that this was just a sample and that more malware existed. They told us that they would not unblock our website until we had found and removed all of the malware ourselves.</p><p>From the lens of censorship and freedom of speech, this action is much more concerning than our previous confrontations. With Namecheap and IONOS, we were facing challenges from a set of providers that we had formally engaged with. We had agreed to Terms of Service and also had alternative infrastructure providers we could switch to in the event of conflict.</p><p>With Chrome, we never agreed to a specific Terms of Service. We don’t have any business relationship or agreement with them. Stated bluntly: If Google decides they don’t like you, then for 65% of the world you simply stop existing. You have no recourse.</p><p>The terrifying thing about this is that Google is not an elected entity. Google has turned themselves into unelected regulators of the Internet, and they are held accountable only to their own share price. Today the ban is on malware, but over time this may grow to cover any type of content that Google does not see as favorable. Google can kick websites off of the Internet as a whole just as easily as they can kick content creators off of YouTube.</p><p>It took us over a year to get all of the pieces right, but we managed to dispel the malware warning by installing a malware scanner on our servers that watches every download request by any user and then runs a scan after the user has completed the download. If the software (we use the open source scanner <a href="https://www.clamav.net/">ClamAV</a>) detects malware, we ban the file for all future users. In practice, this has been enough to appease Google.</p><p>It’s a pretty neat solution, but it’s happening in the wrong place. We are a 16 person startup with $3 million dollars in VC funding and Google is a $1.5 trillion dollar entity with over 100,000 employees. Google decided to solve a malware problem for their users by acting as an unelected regulator for everybody else, pushing the costs of operating a website (and competing with Google itself!) to smaller businesses, which has a side effect of reducing competition for Google.</p><h3>I Have no Mouth and I Must Scream</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*j6_Y-sXOdUkHbU4LQsP3lQ.jpeg" /></figure><p>Somewhere around mid-2021 we experienced a sudden spike in the number infrastructure providers that were de-platforming us. Entities that had previously been pretty chill became hostile and started pulling our servers off of the Internet.</p><p>We checked our emails, we checked our banlist, we checked our abuse management tooling. Everything was indicating that we were still processing reports in a timely fashion and keeping our website relatively clean. If anything, the number of abuse reports we were receiving had gone down.</p><p>And yet, our hosting providers were acting like we were ignoring their abuse complaints. After a moderate amount of frustration and some disjointed communication, we were able to figure out what was happening.</p><p>Emails that contained URLs to our website were being silently dropped. All indications to the sender suggested that the emails were sent successfully, and all indications to the receiver suggested that the emails had never existed at all. They weren’t just going to spam, they were being banished to hell.</p><p>Chrome had been bad enough. We were now being censored at the email layer and it was interfering with our ability to operate as a business. We couldn’t remove abusive content because we couldn’t receive reports. Email is not even part of our user-facing stack!</p><p>We managed to migrate our emails to a new domain and warn our hosting providers to censor the domain name out of the email when filing abuse reports. Most of our hosting providers were happy to oblige, but we had to drop a few that were unable or unwilling to take that extra step.</p><p>And we learned yet another important lesson about censorship. There are powers that be who can decide that you aren’t allowed to use email anymore, and if they don’t want you to exist your business is likely going to fail. It’s not clear who these powers are or what holds them accountable, and it’s not clear how to appeal a mistake if these powers turn against you.</p><h3>Inter-connectivity and the Need for Neutrality</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/612/1*A1_SsqiG_Sn2PVoXLEEb9Q.jpeg" /></figure><p>Every modern business is crucially dependent on a large number of independent services. The political climate of the world is such that every service has started to feel pressure to ensure that all of its customers are acting in a morally upstanding manner. This becomes a challenge when your business depends on services based in dozens of jurisdictions with cultural backgrounds that span hundreds of conflicting moral opinions.</p><p>As our economy and services become more deeply intertwined, an increasing number of players have more influence and ability to de-platform a greater number of businesses and users. And these requirements compound against each other. If one service provider is particularly opinionated and quick to de-platform, everybody else is forced to give them a large amount of breathing room and become more oppressive towards their users to avoid potential conflict.</p><p>This does not scale. The end result will be a global monoculture where everybody is afraid to take risks or break the status quo because nobody can afford to upset even a single of the hundreds of services that they depend on. Our culture gets established and defined by giants like Facebook and Google rather than users and creators, because only Facebook and Google have the resources to bully everyone else into allowing changes to happen.</p><p>The only way to avoid this endgame is to demand infrastructure that remains neutral. At the scale of today’s Internet and global economy, infrastructure that does not remain neutral will inevitably turn on its users and coerce them into a set of moral standards that are both arbitrary and enforced without consent.</p><h3>Meltdown</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*HV-nWmC5Y_tnDXqUy5LM9Q.jpeg" /></figure><p>Up until this point we had dealt with three major types of abuse. Phishing content was being policed at the DNS layer, malware was being policed by the web browser and at the email layer, and we had occasional brushes with law enforcement regarding terrorist propaganda.</p><p>Then one day we started seeing child porn (also called CSAM). While most other types of abusive content are policed selectively, CSAM is actively and aggressively policed by everyone everywhere all the time. Understandably so. When we started seeing CSAM, our infrastructure problems more or less immediately got out of hand.</p><p>Our otherwise favorite hosting provider, Hetzner, declared to us that any CSAM abuse complaints had to be handled within one hour (instead of the typical 24) or they would pull our servers offline. Initially, they gave us 30 days to get the issue under control, but 7 days later they changed their mind and said they were immediately terminating our service, and that we had 48 hours to migrate everything to another provider. Did I mention that Hetzner at this point was nearly half of our fleet? Did I mention that these “48 hours” were December 24 and December 25? Merry Christmas indeed.</p><p>Mevspace didn’t even bother sending us an abuse report. The first time they received word that CSAM was accessible through our website they pulled our servers off the shelf and immediately mailed our hard drives to the police. We never got our data back.</p><p>Between the months of November and January we lost something like 80% of our servers. And then we got hit by this beauty:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*6GbwqgkPcfK5Tv29xp_5jg.png" /></figure><p>Around the world (though mostly in Europe), ISPs had flagged our website as a child abuse website and would no longer let their customers visit. Instead, their customers received the above text, which more or less translates to “STOP, this is a child porn website. Call this hotline and seek help!”</p><p>We have millions of non-pedophile users, many of whom were now being greeted by a message accusing them of pedophilia and encouraging them to seek help. As an incident, this is far worse than merely being knocked offline for a few days. And we now get to add ‘local ISPs’ to the list of infrastructure providers that have taken it upon themselves to ensure that we can’t exist.</p><p>The climax of our experience was a phone call from my landlord. “Hey uh… the child porn police visited you and left a business card. Is there something you need to tell me…?” This was followed by a conversation with a lawyer that ended with “You should stay in Denver for now because we don’t know if they are going to arrest you when you arrive at the airport in Boston.” My Valentine’s Day was more stressful than yours.</p><p>It was too much. We made an executive decision that staying alive was beyond our capabilities, and we let the website collapse.</p><h3>Building Back Better</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2NyJ4nB6vxx0gGpFU5d0iA.jpeg" /></figure><p>The most common suggestion we received in regards to our CSAM problem was to connect our website to Facebook and send them every single file that our users upload, so that Facebook can scan the file and tell us whether the file should be allowed on our website. A similar service is offered by Microsoft, and I believe Apple and Google each have something as well. These services are all free, so it doesn’t seem like that bad of a deal.</p><p>It’s a very bad deal. These services are only going to be free until the entire web has become comfortable with the idea that these services should be mandatory in the name of protecting children. At that point, there will be a monopoly by the big four, and they essentially get to set any price that they want for the right to operate a website on the Internet.</p><p>There’s also no guarantee that these services will remain restricted to the moderation of child pornography. These services are managed by large corporations with profit agendas. If you can’t live without the CSAM filtering, and they decide that you can’t have the CSAM filter without also agreeing to filter out copyright infringing files, your website is forcibly compelled into whatever copyright monitoring scheme they’ve implemented.</p><p>There are also more nefarious things that could happen. Would Facebook refuse an $800 billion deal with China to censor political content? I don’t know, and I don’t want to be in a position where we get to find out.</p><p>These considerations ignore the more basic privacy concerns of sending every file we have to Facebook. Many of our users like us precisely because we aren’t Facebook, and if we’re sending literally all of our data to Facebook we’re also putting ourselves at a steep competitive disadvantage. And as we’ve seen with Amazon, large corporations are more than happy to use an unfair advantage to take over your business.</p><p>So the Facebook solution is out. We will not be sending our user’s files and data to a third-party service in the name of protecting children.</p><p>We’ve now spent more than six months building alternatives. We’ve increased the number of ways that someone can report abuse. We’ve created forms that people can fill out to mass-ban links. We’ve added significantly more robust automated processing of incoming emails. We’ve greatly increased the number of times that we say “this content is not and was never stored on our servers”.</p><p>We’ve directly integrated with the API of NCMEC — the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. When someone reports CSAM, we immediately forward that file to NCMEC along with metadata like IP addresses, timestamps, and (if we have it) information like email addresses and credit card details.</p><p>We’ve improved our blocking practices. We’ve banned more IPs and VPNs than ever, and we’re more consistent about keeping Tor blocked (it’s actually not that trivial to fully block Tor). We’ve started blocking entire IP subnets if there are too many offenders within the subnet.</p><p>Over time, we got our website back online. We got the police off our backs. We got the FBI off our backs. We got Chrome off our backs. Emails containing links to our website appear to send successfully again. We got two alternate websites online in case the main one goes down again. <a href="https://skynetfree.net/">The first</a> is signup only and has done a good job of filtering out abusers, who tend to prefer not to sign up for anything. <a href="https://skynetpro.net">The second</a> requires a monthly credit card payment.</p><p>We’re still being censored by platforms like Twitter. I’m actually not going to link to our original website because I’m worried that Medium and/or Google will respond by reducing this post’s search score, which is actually a perfect example of the chilling effect that happens when censorship is arbitrary and opaque.</p><p>We’re still dealing with foreign police. We don’t even know where to start with repairing relationships with the ISPs that are calling our users pedophiles. My landlord and neighbors don’t trust me anymore and I don’t think there’s much I can do about that besides move. But we’re alive again and we’re growing.</p><h3>The Path Forward</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*GrplFotj2doF50AZ_OLgxQ.jpeg" /></figure><p>Over the next few years, I expect things will get worse rather than better. Based on current comments and conversations coming out of the Biden administration, I do expect Facebook’s child abuse API will become a mandatory part of running a website in America. I think it’s something we need to be actively fighting against, both technologically and politically.</p><p>I also think our solution of just blocking pretty much anything that gets reported is a short-term solution. As we’ve seen with the copyright system on YouTube, if you don’t have good controls in place around who is allowed to file abuse claims, you end up de-platforming a lot of legitimate content at the hands of malicious actors. We’ve already had a number of our users get their legitimate content blocked over incorrect abuse complaints.</p><p>We have to be careful and proactive about our rights when we pick solutions for content management. Especially when CSAM is involved, people tend to lose their minds and reach for the “burn it all down immediately” solution. And because people get so worked up, CSAM ends up being very useful for pushing malicious corporate and political agendas. When someone claims that a concession or rights infringement is “to protect children”, you need to be extra careful.</p><p>Which means there’s a lot to build. Content moderation is an important problem, not just for malware, phishing, and CSAM, but also for more mundane problems like spam. If we don’t tackle the problem head-on, centralized corporations like Facebook and Google <strong>will </strong>solve the problem for us, and they will do it by taking even greater control of our lives.</p><p>I have a lot of thoughts and ideas about things we can be doing to build a future that both protects the freedoms of users and also inhibits content like spam and CSAM. But many of those ideas are still early and are outside the scope of this blog post today.
