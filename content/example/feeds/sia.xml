            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ip-nw3fZ4NGfmy9ta8HYgw.png" /></figure><p>We’re back with the State of Sia, a monthly installment looking at development and team updates for The Sia Foundation.</p><p>We hope you’ve been well since our last update. The penultimate month of 2022 was filled with progress as we worked on major initiatives and welcomed new team members. You’ll hear about both shortly!</p><p>The first of these updates released last month and was received quite well in the community. We were incredibly pleased to see that. We want to better communicate the progress we make, and it seems like this update is shaping up to be a great first step towards that goal.</p><p>We could also <a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1586127052767318016/photo/1">print out the code</a> and send it to you, but we’ll stick with this method for now.</p><h3>Development</h3><h4>renterd</h4><p>renterd will be our new stand-alone renter.</p><p>Significant progress continues on the new renterd. A meeting of the minds for the three developers involved resulted in an architectural overhaul of the app. renterd will now consist of three components: worker, bus, and autopilot (names could change). <a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/renterd/pull/16">Here&#39;s the PR</a>, and here’s the tl;dr:</p><p>bus is the source of the truth for the stuff, worker does the stuff, and autopilot makes all the stuff happen easily. “Stuff” in this case of course being the litany of contract formations, blockchain checking, downloads, and other work that any particular instance of Sia used for renting must do.</p><p>This architecture allows renterd to scale horizontally (important for third party use), and will let our devs work mostly independently as they each tackle a component.</p><p>renterd also saw continued work on its UI, primarily related to the new autopilot system, and designing it into the host and contracts features.</p><p>Some specific bits added to autopilot this month included:</p><ul><li>an initial autopilot loop</li><li>a contractor</li><li>a host scanner</li><li>host filtering and scoring</li><li>migrated the backend (object store, contract store and hostdb) over to a SQL database</li><li>currently working on object repairs in the autopilot</li><li>building a test suite for integration tests</li></ul><p>For worker, contributions were made to host metrics.</p><h4>hostd</h4><p>hostd is the app you’ll be using to rent out your excess storage space to the Sia network.</p><ul><li>Refactored the financial manager</li><li>Fixed accounting issues related to ephemeral accounts</li><li>Refactored the MDM executor</li><li>Added financial tracking to all income sources for RHP2 and RHP3</li><li>Migrated financial store and contract metadata store to SQLite from BadgerDB. Tested a wallet store with SQLite.</li><li>Added integration tests for financials</li><li>Additional consistency tests for siad renters</li></ul><h4>skyrecover</h4><p>skyrecover is a set of utilities to recover lost skyd data.</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/skyrecover/commit/1b4ee10d757df0efdac09349349699a2bb99f962">Fix issue recovering small files</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/skyrecover/commit/97ad97319f3c536999ac877f591e45bcd6fb4921">Added tool to scan base sectors for a specific checksum</a></li></ul><h4>walletd</h4><p>walletd will be the place to store your Siacoins.</p><p>We worked on making the jape API checker <a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/jape/pull/5">more robust</a>. These checks prevent a common developer error where more than one HTTP response is sent.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/walletd/pull/8">This PR</a> added the bitcoin coin selection and the single random draw selection algorithm to the walletd rewrite. We’re now working on simulating past transactions to see which algorithm is more efficient in terms of minimizing fees.</p><h4>web</h4><p>We refactored styling across the Sia design system and apps, migrating all code to Tailwind, a popular CSS framework. Tailwind’s widespread use amongst developers will make future contributions to Sia’s UI code easier. We also updated the website to be more optimized for mobile layouts (and other minor updates to content).</p><h3>Team Updates</h3><p>Chris joined the team in November! To say this is a great pick up for the Foundation is an understatement. Coming from Skynet Labs, Chris has been working on Sia for longer than anyone except for Sia’s co-founders Luke and David. He brings intimate knowledge of the codebase and wonderful new ideas to the team.</p><p>Here’s what Luke had to say about Chris joining the Sia Foundation.</p><blockquote>We have another exciting addition to announce: Chris has joined the Foundation! Chris really needs no introduction; he discovered Sia in the early days of the project, and has been making enormously valuable contributions ever since, spanning nearly the entire codebase. Needless to say, I’m very pleased to have him aboard to lend his experience and passion to renterd, Utreexo, and beyond. Welcome! :)</blockquote><blockquote><em>- Luke Champine, President and Core Developer of The Sia Foundation</em></blockquote><p>This is our last new hire for 2022. With three recent pick ups to add to an already excellent team, the Sia Foundation is well-positioned to rocket into 2023.</p><h3>Other Foundation Happenings</h3><h4>Advent of Code</h4><p>Advent of Code returns for 2022! AoC is a daily code challenge that can test your skills in fun and interesting ways. Join our private leaderboard using code 30280-c51e2e3e. Anyone who completes at least seven days will receive a prize (to be determined) from the Foundation!</p><h4>Quarterly update</h4><p>We’re working on our latest Quarterly Update, which you’ll see posted via our socials on January 1, 2023. Be sure to check out our previous updates over on <a href="https://sia.tech/about-sia-foundation">our website</a>.</p><p>These updates are an important part of the transparency that we promote here, giving our community insight into our highlighted work, financials, and future plans.</p><h4>Grants Program</h4><p>The Grants Program is finding its stride, allowing for community members to get funds for their Sia-related project. We recently published our first <a href="https://blog.sia.tech/grants-program-update-november-2022-83dd4a7e266e">Grants Program update</a>, detailing the first two grants that we’ve approved. This will be a new monthly post that you can check over at <a href="https://blog.sia.tech">blog.sia.tech</a> to find out the latest grant happenings.</p><p>We’re absolutely thrilled to be seeing new proposals dropping into the forum. If you think you’ve got a great idea to benefit the Sia ecosystem, submit your proposal over at <a href="https://forum.sia.tech">forum.sia.tech</a>.</p><h3>That’s all folks</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/710/0*PGPgZLGigMIJP6VN.jpeg" /></figure><p>Thanks for another great month! As we move toward the end of the year, we’re thankful for such a wonderful community. 2023 will see great things for the Sia Foundation, but we’re not through with 2022 yet. See you next time.</p><p><a href="https://discord.gg/sia">Discord</a>, <a href="mailto:hello@sia.tech">Email</a></p><h3>Steve</h3><p>steve#4381 on Discord</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=d2b9551d08dd" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://blog.sia.tech/the-state-of-sia-december-2022-d2b9551d08dd">The State of Sia, December 2022</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.sia.tech">The Sia Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Grants Program was created to fund research, development, developer tools, and anything else that will support and further our mission of user-owned data while enriching the Sia ecosystem.</p><p>Just design a proposal that meets our requirements, submit to our forums, and wait for review by our grants committee. If your grant gets approved, you’re on your way to creating the next great project on the Sia storage network.</p><p>Check out <a href="https://sia.tech/grants">our site</a> for more info.</p><h3>The Current State of Grants</h3><p>We launched the Grants Program two months ago, and in that time have reviewed three grant proposals. A couple more just dropped this week, but we’ll have more info on those later.</p><p>Two have been conditionally approved, and the third is awaiting some updates to the proposal. All three have potential to add great new features and tools to the Sia ecosystem, and we’re excited to see them develop as we move forward.</p><p>Let’s take a look at the two approved grants.</p><h4>Lume Web</h4><p>Status: <strong>Approved</strong></p><p>Lume Web is a project that aims to “unify the dWeb” and make strides towards a better web3. With plans for a Firefox browser extension for viewing web3 content, building upon his third party Skynet portal, and creating new educational sites for this new tech, Lume Web wants to be a major player in the still developing space. Longer term goals include a custom web browser and becoming the open hub for web3.</p><p>Derrick Hammer, Lume’s developer, plans to accomplish these goals throughout 2023. Here’s what Derrick had to say about Lume and his grant:</p><blockquote>I believe Lume is going to be the center hub of web3 and this is giving me a once in a lifetime opportunity to build an open ecosystem and have the community support me.</blockquote><blockquote>Simply put: Lume Web is web3 for the masses. Web1 was AOL, Web2 is Google, and Web3 will be Lume 🙃</blockquote><h4>Sia Satellite</h4><p>Status: <strong>Approved</strong></p><p>Sia Satellite wants to cut down barriers to entry. Currently, someone who wants to use Sia needs to get Siacoins in order to form contracts and pay the hosts who store their data. Sia Satellite will serve as an intermediary who handles all the complicated blockchain and contract stuff, leaving the user to pay for their storage easily with a credit card.</p><p>Developer Michael Bulanov submitted an ambitious proposal on a six month time line, and the grants committee recommended splitting up work into multiple parts/grants for more focused progress.</p><p>Mike is also a Sia Grants Committee member, and was therefore excluded from the discussion and approval process for Sia Satellite. He kept it simple when asked how he felt after his proposal was approved:</p><blockquote>Well, how do I feel… I feel, like, WOW!, I seem to have gone up to the next level of personal development.</blockquote><h3>Coming Next</h3><p>The committee has two new grants to sort through, and one to review updates for. We’re incredibly excited to have so many new opportunities to expand the Sia ecosystem with these wonderful community projects.</p><p>You can see the list of all proposals <a href="https://forum.sia.tech/c/foundation/grants/">here</a>, and our proposal requirements <a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/about-the-grants-category/">here</a>. See you next month!</p><h4>p.s.</h4><p>Want to see more next update? Should we talk about all active proposals instead of just the current list of approved ones? Let us know!</p><h3>Steve</h3><p>steve#4381 on Discord</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=83dd4a7e266e" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://blog.sia.tech/grants-program-update-november-2022-83dd4a7e266e">Grants Program Update, November 2022</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.sia.tech">The Sia Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*P8rQ82pVc5_b690s_JhZNw.png" /></figure><p>Hello Sia community! Welcome to the first State of Sia, a new monthly installment looking at development and team updates for The Sia Foundation.</p><p>We decided that — considering the size of the team and dev manpower — these should be released once a month. That could easily change as we develop more sophisticated project management and bring on new talent, but you can expect that cadence for the first few iterations here.</p><p>Speaking of iterations, things might change month-to-month as we find our stride and gather community feedback on how best to present this info.</p><p>Finally, some of our repos are still private. For those that remember the many PR links of the Sia dev updates back in the pre-Skynet Labs days, know that we’ll re-instate those as we begin to make these repos public over the coming weeks and months.</p><p>That’s enough from me, so let’s get on with it!</p><h3>Development</h3><p>Let’s take a look at the progress of each major development initiative and what to expect moving forward.</p><h4>Our next-gen apps</h4><p>The current Sia-UI and siad let you interact with all of Sia in one app, but part of our updates to these will be splitting functionality into multiple separate programs. We know from years of experience that having everything together under a single roof results in a lot of dead weight for a vast majority of users. Even folks who do need it all usually use a separate instance for each use case. A quick example of this is that they might not want their long term siacoin storage intermingled with their renting funds, but there are lots of other scenarios that we hope to accommodate with this change.</p><p>Splitting everything up will result in three new apps: renterd for purchasing storage space to upload files, hostd for renting out your excess storage space to renters, and walletd if all you need to do is to hold siacoins somewhere safe.</p><h4>renterd</h4><p>renterd will be our new stand-alone renter. As with each next-gen app, there will be a UI client as well as the essential CLI version.</p><ul><li>Implemented parallel transfer algorithms for uploading, downloading, and migrating sector data (<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/renterd/commit/817effb2d53d718a7c5f0f8369ff8f7ffcc0a300">Link</a>). This was an important function that allows renterd to behave like a good renter should and run lots of different tasks simultaneously.</li><li>Fixed deadlock + nil panic bugs, located courtesy of our most recent dev hire PJ!</li><li>Finished initial autopilot design and began work on host scanning/ranking. Autopilot is a critical feature that lets a renter get used by a non-developer. It automatically ranks hosts, forms contracts, and migrates (repairs) file data, and is by far the most complicated part of any renter.</li><li>Fixed a bug in renterd causing the object store to not be persisted</li><li>Worked on contract and host management UI features for renterd, leveraging much of last month’s work on similar features for hostd. Focused on consistency across renterd and hostd features, so all features feel familiar and follow the same user workflows</li></ul><h4>hostd</h4><p>hostd is the app you’ll be using to rent out your excess storage space to the Sia network.</p><ul><li>Finished reimplementing the MDM, accounts, registry, and RHP3 for hostd</li><li>Finished a test RHP3 renter for hostd</li><li>Built out the single address wallet module that is used in both the renterd and hostd UI applications. The wallet features an intuitive wizard and supports multiple currencies</li></ul><h4>walletd</h4><p>Finally, walletd will be the place to store your Siacoins.</p><ul><li>Added a JSON store and tests to preserve wallet data</li><li>Added an API test</li><li>Changed walletd’s API to use the jape framework instead of httprouter</li><li>Added hot and read-only wallet tests</li></ul><h4>web</h4><p>We made a series of updates to the website, including <a href="https://sia.tech/grants">the new grants page</a> where community members can learn how to get funding for their projects.</p><p>Website updates also include <a href="https://sia.tech/software/renterd">the new </a><a href="https://sia.tech/software/renterd">renterd landing page</a> which features screenshots of all the above mentioned work — so it’s another great place to stay up to date on the new renterd software! A similar page for hostd is coming soon.</p><h4>Stray dev bits</h4><ul><li>Built a utility to recover lost Skynet data using the file metadata</li></ul><h3>Team Updates</h3><p>PJ Brone joined the dev team in October, bringing his talents and extensive Sia ecosystem knowledge directly from Skynet Labs. Interestingly, PJ is one of the few devs on the former Skynet Labs team to have actually worked on Sia. Here’s what Luke had to say about PJ joining the team.</p><blockquote>PJ is a veteran of the Sia ecosystem and has a clear passion for writing high-quality code. He’ll be working with me directly on <em>renterd</em> and other core dev projects, which will be a big help. PJ is super friendly, hard-working, and deeply interested in making Sia a better platform for everyone. I&#39;m excited to see what we can build together. :)</blockquote><blockquote><em>- Luke Champine, President and Core Developer of The Sia Foundation</em></blockquote><p>Keep your eyes peeled this month. I think you’ll be happy to see another familiar face joining the Foundation.</p><h3>Other Foundation Happenings</h3><h4>Host memo update</h4><p>Work continues on our legal memo for hosts, and we still believe we are on track for a condensed, usable version of the findings to be published in Q4 of this year.</p><h4>Streamlining operations</h4><p>As we expand our talent pool and grow our operations team (by one 🙂), we’ve been refining our processes to better accommodate international contributors and non-profit standards.</p><h4>Grants Program</h4><p>The first ever grant has been approved by the Foundation’s Grants Program! Lume Web, which aims to unify the dWeb, will be built by community member pcfreak30 (Derrick) over the next year with grant funding.</p><p>We’ll have a separate blog post this month discussing the latest Grants Program updates, so stay tuned. Congrats to pcfreak30 and Lume!</p><h3>That’s all folks</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/710/1*UUUV6hsBIfO7qYzmUUJ96w.jpeg" /></figure><p>Thanks for reading this far! We’ll be back in another month as we march toward the end of the year, and we’ll have more info on our Q4 progress as well as our plans for 2023.

Skynet will remain online.</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Qb2ylwebgLLlvo0iQoTyZw.png" /></figure><p>It is with regret that we announce Skynet Labs has been unable to complete its next round of fundraising and will be shutting down. Thankfully, Skynet as a platform will be able to continue operating: all user files will remain online and key portions of the infrastructure will continue to be actively developed. Unfortunately, Skynet will have to continue without Skynet Labs and without many of the amazing people who have put their heart and soul into building a brighter future for users and user data.</p><p>Much of what Skynet has accomplished, including its ability to continue operating in the face of Skynet Lab’s dissolution, and including its ability to provide value to the wider web3 ecosystem, is owed to the efforts and contributions of the Skynet Labs team members. It is with great sadness that we will be letting the members of our team go, even though we have every need for and appreciation of their efforts.</p><p><strong>Read the full announcement to the Skynet community including what to expect next on </strong><a href="https://siasky.net/FAD8MqXHfRSbFXdZpQhw4Q09_ZWP2a-miEchmm0VUSzDUA"><strong>Siasky.net</strong></a><strong> or </strong><a href="https://skynetfree.net/FAD8MqXHfRSbFXdZpQhw4Q09_ZWP2a-miEchmm0VUSzDUA"><strong>Skynetfree.net</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=5397184e214d" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://blog.sia.tech/skynet-labs-is-shutting-down-skynet-remains-online-5397184e214d">Skynet Labs is shutting down.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*FYnTJZXVPZ1JjIxyodujQQ.png" /></figure><p>Long overdue, but I’m happy to present the latest update for Skynet’s roadmap. Our <a href="https://blog.sia.tech/the-worrying-depth-and-scope-of-censorship-on-the-internet-ffd4bc5a5486">recent chaos</a> has caused us to reconsider what technology decisions are acceptable, and what it takes to build a robust platform that meets user expectations for decentralization.</p><h3>Fluid Skynet Portals</h3><p>It has become clear to us that we cannot use portals as a stable piece of infrastructure. The original idea behind portals was to make them a trusted, centralized infrastructure, but allow users to easily switch between portals in the event that a portal went offline. Users would have to find trustworthy portals but would have no exposure to vendor lock-in.</p><p>This original model was (and still is) several steps ahead of most web3 providers. Major infrastructure providers like Infura and Open Sea are both closed source and difficult to operate. Skynet portals on the other hand are open source and readily swapped out from each other.</p><p>The challenges with the original model were nonetheless significant. Users on different portals had difficulties sharing files with each other because files uploaded to one portal had a completely different URL than files to another portal. Retrieving files from a different portal required making changes to the URL, which is not difficult but is inconvenient.</p><p>The UX annoyances surrounding Skynet portals become more pronounced when we started experiencing regular deplatformings. Siasky became unstable, and even users who were using a common portal had to frequently change out the URL.</p><p>To address this, we’ve kicked off a project called the Skynet Kernel, which is a webapp plugin that automatically switches the user to their favorite portal, including being able to automatically use failovers if the user’s preferred portal is offline or otherwise unavailable. Thanks to Kernel, users can expect a reliable and consistent experience regardless of which portals they use, which portals their friends use, and which portals are currently offline.</p><p>The Skynet Kernel also means that less user education is required to get people using Skynet because Skynet overall feels significantly more like the traditional web, despite being decentralized.</p><h3>Skynet Portal APIs</h3><p>Portals on Skynet were originally, like most other web3 infrastructure, fully trusted. Users were expected to find a reliable and trustworthy portal operator and then hope that the operator did not inject malicious code while they were using Skynet.</p><p>Though this is how pretty much all of web3 works, we lost faith in the model. Especially when users are using multiple infrastructure providers and failing over between them, users need to have confidence that they are protected against all forms of malice.</p><p>We have since updated the Skynet portal APIs so that all major functions have fully verifiable endpoints. <strong>To the best of my knowledge, Skynet is the only web3 platform today that has accomplished this.</strong> Whether you are uploading files to Skynet (files of any size!), downloading files from Skynet (again, files of any size!), or using dynamic content, the portals offer cryptographic assurance that the request is being completed correctly.</p><p>The one major caveat with this upgrade is that modern web browsers do not have the ability to verify these cryptographic proofs. To get fully proper assurance that the portal is not acting maliciously, users need to install the Skynet Kernel browser extension. Even without a browser extension, we are able to significantly reduce user exposure to malice, but a user is only fully safe if they install the extension.</p><p>While the API supports all types of interactions trustlessly, the Skynet Kernel currently only supports registry actions, and small file actions (both uploads and downloads). The browser extension also does not yet support trustless webapp loading. All of these features are being developed, and we will get Skynet to the point of being fully trustless before too long.</p><h3>Skynet Portal Setup</h3><p>One critical focus for the Skynet team has been the ability for third parties to easily set up their own portals. A few months back we even had a workshop for people to set up their own portals. The workshop was nearly successful, with just a few hiccups that made a start-to-finish setup difficult for participants.</p><p>The portal stack has since gotten a bit more complicated, mostly owing to processes that we’ve had to add as a response to the turbulence of being continuously de-platformed. The portal now has more robust processes related to file repair and more robust processes related to MongoDB. Some of the health checks are also more robust.</p><p>As a result, we still haven’t yet achieved the creation of a simple workshop that can get a portal operator from zero to fully established in under 4 hours, but it has become a top priority for us and we hope to have the workshop completed within a month.</p><p>Two key upgrades since our previous workshop include switching from LastPass to Hashicorp and enabling support for text file configurations. Both upgrades should make it significantly easier for individuals to set up their own portals, and the removal of LastPass means we no longer have closed-source products as part of our portal stack.</p><p>We will reach out to the community soon with details about our next workshop — stay tuned!</p><h3>Improved Renter Stability</h3><p>Between the chaos of continuous de-platforming, the influx of new hosts, and the price turbulence on the network, the upload, download, and repair systems of the renter were put under stress. At one point, we lost user files due to our servers being fully unplugged without us having time to react.</p><p>Several bugs and instabilities have been fixed related to these systems. Downloads are now more stable and consistently fast. Uploads are also more consistently fast. Files more consistently stay in good health, and the total amount of repair required to keep a set of files online has been reduced.</p><p>One key change that we’ve made is that file repair now happens across servers as well as within a server. Prior to this enhancement, if a server got randomly ripped offline (say by an over-eager IT admin who is antsy about some phishing reports), the files that had been on that server would live for about a month before falling off the network, with no easy way to recover.</p><p>We now have a cross-server repair system that allows one server to tell if another server is no longer able to repair files. In that case, it’ll assume the responsibility and get the files up to good health. So long as a portal cluster has at least one server with operating capacity, files will not be lost from the cluster even if many of the servers are being brutally ripped offline.</p><h3>SDK Evolution</h3><p>As a part of the transition to a more fully decentralized stack, we’re beginning to transition the developer ecosystem from using skynet-js to using the libkernel and libkmodule libraries, which are part of the Skynet Kernel toolkit. At this point, both libkernel and libkmodule are still in alpha and are not recommended for fully deployed production applications. We expect to transition to beta within a few weeks, and then to v1.0 a few weeks after that. If all goes well, libkernel and libkmodule should be the default recommended libraries starting in October.</p><p>If you are familiar with the Skynet ecosystem, you know that Skynet development is broken into two major categories: webapps and <a href="https://docs.skynetlabs.com/skynet-topics/mysky-and-dacs">Data Access Controllers</a>. Previously, both types of development were done using skynet-js, which was effective but especially didn’t give DACs all of the features that they needed to be maximally useful. Furthermore, the standard for DACs was to use iframes, which had significant enough performance limitations that they really couldn’t be used in a composable way.</p><p>The new ecosystem tooling addresses this by moving DACs from iframes to web workers, where they are 10–30x faster in the naive case, and as much as 1000x faster in the optimized case. These performance boosts make composability tractable for real-time user applications. Further, DACs now have their own special library — libkmodule, which provides tooling that removes almost all of the boilerplate involved with writing DACs and allows developers to focus on the fun parts.</p><p>We’ve also updated the naming a bit. You will often now hear DACs referred to as “Kernel modules”, because Kernel modules provide substantially more functionality than the original DACs.</p><h3>The Skynet Kernel</h3><p>When computing transitioned from most applications being on the desktop to most applications being in the web browser, the user gained an enormous amount of convenience in the form of all of their data and experiences being available from every device, and all of their data surviving adventures like getting a new laptop.</p><p>This convenience came at a steep price, which is that corporations now control all of the user’s data, and the user transitions into a feudal state where they have to do things like rent the tools they use for work, and rent the music they listen to and the movies they watch. And they have to live with the fact that key parts of their lives can be taken away from them at any time.</p><p>The Skynet Kernel is a new programming paradigm that gives users all of the convenience of apps in the web browser with all of the liberty and control of running an open source desktop like Linux. It effectively allows webapps to run entirely in the client, while simultaneously having access to APIs that act like a cloud.</p><p>The Kernel is a fully trustless application environment. Every piece of code that runs is verified in full by the user, and at the user’s discretion can be swapped out with different code. All interactions with Skynet are verified cryptographically, ensuring the user can’t be lied to by the cloud. And because all of the programs run on the client, this also means that apps can’t be upgraded without the user’s permission — features that were once free can’t suddenly start charging money, because the user has the full autonomy to downgrade.</p><p>The Kernel can be used across the entire web3 ecosystem. The programming paradigm is fully generalized, which means you can use it to create trustless relays from webapps to things like the Ethereum blockchain. You can even use the Skynet kernel to inject trustless relays into centralized applications like OpenSea, allowing users to see the full list of assets even if the application itself is engaging in censorship.</p><h3>The Skynet Token Framework</h3><p>The Kernel is even powerful enough to run entire blockchains from the web browser. One of the biggest struggles of decentralized blockchains to date was figuring out how to convince everyday users to run full nodes. This problem is so difficult that most projects have entirely given up on it, and instead encourage users to depend on relays and trusted infrastructure.</p><p>We believe this problem can be solved by placing the blockchain full node directly into the browser via the Skynet Kernel. Users don’t even have to be aware that the full node is there, working in the background to verify all of their transactions. And this is exactly how the Skynet token will work. Every user will be using the blockchain from a full node.</p><p>However, the full Skynet token framework is so much more than a blockchain in the browser. It’s a means for Skynet applications to monetize without disrupting user experience. Skynet token is a micropayments platform that allows applications to charge users hundredths of a cent per page view without needing ads or consent paywalls. In one sense it’s like ERC20 on steroids, and in another sense, it’s like Patreon on steroids.</p><p>In the full design, every single user gets their own token. And every single application gets its own token. And every single piece of content released on Skynet gets its own token. That’s because on the web, contributions are provided by everyone. On Skynet, Reddit Karma isn’t just fake imaginary points, it’s monetization that pays users back for contributing meaningfully to the Internet.</p><p>The Skynet token blockchain features a large number of novel technologies, including Skynet-based block distribution, utreexo-based state management, a low power consumption proof of work algorithm, and a token framework similar to ERC20 that has no MEV. Everything has been optimized to run in the browser, ensuring that users who access Skynet exclusively from their phones are still able to enjoy the full benefits of a trustless blockchain.</p><p>Development progress for Skynet token is already well underway. We’re just a few weeks from having a fully functional in-browser blockchain featuring empty blocks. This includes support for miners, mining pools, and support for a peer-to-peer network. Once the empty-block chain is alive, we’ll be working on a wallet with support for the SKT asset (Skynet Token). And after that, we’ll finally implement and release the full token ecosystem.</p><h3>Focused on Fundamentals</h3><p>Over the past year, we’ve been quietly and persistently upgrading Skynet. We are sharply focused on two key objectives:</p><ol><li>Uncompromising decentralization</li><li>A user experience that is comparable to web2</li></ol><p>Achieving both of those things at the same time has required a substantial amount of innovation, but we are fortunate enough to have a team that is more than capable of consistently churning out new updates that push the boundaries of our industry.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=4aaf2ddf6587" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://blog.sia.tech/skynet-roadmap-and-update-summer-2022-4aaf2ddf6587">Skynet Roadmap and Update: Summer 2022</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.sia.tech">The Sia Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This degree of trust in centralized tech is a slippery slope that enables malicious behavior from special interest groups, political parties, and rogue developers.</p><p>As users are looking for a way out of the black hole and iron fist of today’s social platforms, Web3 has cast a new vision for mainstream adoption of trustless, decentralized social applications that are owned by users, instead of corporations.</p><p>Over the past two years, Skynet has focused on building decentralized infrastructure for developers to support a new wave of web3 social dApps that put users first. Our vision is to see the next Twitter, Youtube, and Facebook be trustless applications that allow user ownership of data, identity, and social graphs. With trustless social dApps built around data interoperability, users can easily move across applications without having to risk social consequences or being locked out of features that have become integral to everyday living.</p><h3>Ownership Economy and Creator Tokens</h3><p>The rise of NFT’s in 2021 proved that the creators have a place in web3, but NFTs are just the tip of the iceberg. Web3 coined the term “Ownership Economy”, promising a new method of monetization to replace the pitfalls of advertising models. Creator Tokens are the new stocks of web3, granting users’ ownership and financial stake in the platforms they use and the communities they build.</p><p>Skynet extends the token monetization model of the ownership economy not only to content creators, but developers as well. Kernel, Skynet’s newest release will allow developers to build on decentralized and interoperable data, enabling monetization of shared code and trustless API’s saved on Skynet. This fuels sustainable innovation and platform diversity while distributing wealth among all contributors, whether you’re a content creator on a social application or a core contributor to open-sourced code.</p><h3>Developer Infrastructure for Social Applications</h3><p>Decentralized storage and infrastructure pave the way for social dApps that give control back to users. Our platform emphasizes ease of use, developer ergonomics, and matches the performance and scalability of web2 infrastructure. With the upcoming launch of Skynet Kernel, developers will be able to build decentralized API’s and share data between applications in a verifiable and trustless way.</p><p>There are countless web2 applications yet to be decentralized for a web3 future.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Pfkgp2P-Q_9t2640iUX7Fw.png" /></figure><p>Just as everyone is getting used to the new world of web3, it’s time to introduce a new technology: <strong>web5</strong>. It’s confusing and unfortunate, but it’s the name that’s been chosen and it has a real vision behind it that’s worth paying attention to.</p><p>Web3 is a catch-all term for anything cryptocurrency. And while cryptocurrency used to imply ideals of decentralization and user ownership, today it covers an ocean of projects and financial innovations, and no longer has a strong central narrative beyond ‘innovative digital objects of value’. The heavy dilution of the web3 narrative has created a vision gap that web5 has come to replace.</p><p>Web5 is specifically focused on users, their identity, their data, and the idea that we can build large-scale applications such that users have control rather than corporations. For web5, cryptocurrency is a background element — it’s useful sometimes, but it’s just a tool and not a core principle or driving reason to exist.</p><p>Web5 couldn’t come at a better time. Users are more aware than ever that they do not control their online presence and they do not control their online future.</p><p>This was underscored recently by Elon Musk’s bid to acquire Twitter. By throwing around tens of billions of dollars, Elon Musk demonstrated that he has the power to take unilateral control of a platform that has enormous influence over the global political landscape.</p><p>The hidden Twitter story though is the people and communities that use and depend on Twitter every day. The majority of the value of Twitter is not created by people on Twitter’s payroll, but by unpaid users who have spent an enormous amount of effort building up their online presence, which includes both their social graph and also their persona.</p><p>Because of this, acquiring Twitter is different than acquiring something like a laptop company, a restaurant, or a movie studio. For traditional companies, most of the value is created by the company (or people who are getting paid by the company), and most of the effort involved in delivering the end product comes from the company itself. The consumer’s burden in buying and consuming the product is a fraction of the total effort that went into creating the product.</p><p>Twitter is less like a traditional company and more like a small nation or government. In order to use Twitter, you have to put material effort into growing your social network. Furthermore, this effort is entirely non-transferable. If you decide that you don’t like Twitter’s policies or terms of service, your only recourse is to abandon your friends and followers and start from scratch on a new platform.</p><p>If Twitter were a grocery store, it would be a grocery store where the shoppers themselves planted all the trees, tended to all the animals, and the only compensation the shoppers receive is the ability to consume the food that they grew themselves — they aren’t even allowed to consume the food produced by other shoppers! If some new rule appears (like “Twitter is now for vegan food only!), the shoppers’ only recourse is to start over with seeds and baby animals in a new grocery store.</p><p>Twitter of course is just one example. These dynamics are at play on every major social platform — Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, Twitch, Snapchat, Discord, and so on — all of these platforms are platforms where the majority of value is created by the users rather than the companies, and all the users of these platforms cannot easily switch to a new platform if new or unwanted policies are introduced.</p><p>Perhaps the most brutal example is the sale of WhatsApp to Facebook. Prior to its acquisition, WhatsApp was a world leader in privacy and encryption. Users chose WhatsApp in part because of the security and privacy it offered, and they put a great amount of effort into pulling their family and friends on this privacy-first network. After the acquisition, the story changed to “give all of your private information and data to Facebook or you will not be able to speak to your grandmother anymore”. Again, social networks are more like nations and governments than they are like traditional companies that sell products.</p><h3>So where does Web5 fit into this?</h3><p>Web5 is a bleeding edge class of technology that’s aimed at solving this problem for social media. And specifically, web5 wants to solve this problem by putting the data in the hands of users, rather than having the data owned by the corporations.</p><p>Web5 goes a step further than just governance. The governance solution would insist that users need to vote and consent to any change of power like a transfer from the WhatsApp company to the Facebook company, or a transfer from the Twitter board of directors to Elon Musk. The web5 solution insists that social media platforms should be commoditized, and just as shoppers could switch from grocery store to grocery store, users should be able to switch between Twitter and TikTok with the same ease (and without losing their followers or friends)</p><p>If web5 is successful, events like Elon Musk acquiring Twitter lose much of their societal implication. In a web2 world, when Elon Musk owns Twitter, he captures users who have little alternative or ability to switch away. In a web5 world, he gains an audience, but it’s an audience that has the full freedom to leave for greener pastures if they decide that Elon’s changes are unfavorable.</p><p>Web5’s goals are ambitious. The entire Internet was built around the idea that the server owns and controls all of the data, and that the users trust and depend on the server. For user’s to own the data, several dramatic shifts are needed in the way web applications are built.</p><p>In many ways, the biggest problem is identity. And while identity is traditionally thought of as a set of credentials that you use to prove yourself, your online identity is actually useless if it’s not also accompanied by all of your data. And by “your data” we don’t just mean your files on DropBox. We mean the list of friends you have, your message history, all of the music playlists you’ve created, all the videos you’ve liked — every piece of data that’s required from users to build a modern web application is a part of your online identity.</p><p><strong>Web5 solves this problem with decentralized storage.</strong> All of a user’s data is stored in a decentralized cloud where the public data (such as blog posts, social media videos, etc) can be accessed by anyone, and the private data (such as personal photos, download history, etc) can only be accessed by properly authorized parties.</p><p><strong>Central to the idea of decentralized storage is also decentralized certification/authentication.</strong> When you are reading data from a user, you want to be able to verify that the data was actually published by that user. This is typically an easy problem to solve once you have decentralized storage — wherever you are storing the data, you can also store a signature that authenticates the data. These signatures make data re-hostable; data published by one user can be stored and distributed by any arbitrary third party, and users who fetch the data from a third party can still be confident that it the correct original data.</p><p><strong>The other major problem facing Web5 is compatibility.</strong> If you want users to easily migrate between platforms while retaining their data and connections to other users, you need data to be interoperable. Different applications need to use compatible formats for their data.</p><p>Most Web5 projects address the compatibility challenge with a concept known as “schemas”<strong>.</strong> The general idea behind a schema is that you formally define a specification for a specific type of data and expect everyone to adhere perfectly to that specification. Every new type of data needs a new schema, and every application developer needs to learn all of the schemas of any data that they wish to be compatible with.</p><h3>Web5 Data Schemes Versus Skynet Modules</h3><p>At Skynet Labs, we found the idea of schemas to be incredibly cumbersome and came up with an alternative solution called “modules”. Modules share data by creating APIs rather than schemas, and mimic the way that most of the Internet shares data today. The APIs run locally in webworkers rather than on remote servers, making them decentralized. Otherwise, they create and manage data in much of the same way that traditional websites create and manage data. This approach allows for:</p><ul><li>Rapid development</li><li>More flexibility in introducing changes or upgrades to data formats</li><li>Substantially reduces the total coordination required between different developers to share data</li></ul><p>While Web5 is the new kid on the block (no pun intended) with funding and Jack Dorsey’s name behind it, a lot of the old players in the web3 space and building under the same principles that web5 proposes.</p><p>Skynet Labs, my own company, has been working on Web5 ideas and building a community of developers for 2.5 years now. Our platform emphasizes ease of use, developer ergonomics, and matching the performance and scalability of web2 platforms.</p><p>The other two major players in the space are Dat/Hypercore and Ceramic. While some might include IPFS as a player too, IPFS is more narrowly focused on infrastructure and has not done as much to solve the challenges surrounding identity and data interoperability.. (Typically when you think Web5 + IPFS, you think Ceramic).</p><p>Each of the major web5 players has a slightly different approach, but we’re all working towards the same goal — give control of the Internet back to the users. We all agree that the Internet is in bad shape, and we would all like to return to the open data archive that used to exist. We also all believe that it’s possible, and that an Internet with open data under the Web5 ideals will be more innovative and more beneficial to humanity than the Internet we have today.</p><p>If you would like to learn more or even join the fight to take back the Internet, come visit our discord at <a href="https://discord.gg/skynetlabs">https://discord.gg/skynetlabs</a></p><p>For extra web5 content, watch our Twitter Spaces that we hosted!</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FnzQK3ixyXP0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DnzQK3ixyXP0&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FnzQK3ixyXP0%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/232d12ae3a22b8fd5198ff39d3cde847/href">https://medium.com/media/232d12ae3a22b8fd5198ff39d3cde847/href</a></iframe><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=6c60c8056732" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://blog.sia.tech/decentralized-identity-and-web5-explained-6c60c8056732">Decentralized Identity and “Web5” Explained</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.sia.tech">The Sia Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>
