The Grants Program was created to fund research, development, developer tools, and anything else that will support and further our mission of user-owned data while enriching the Sia ecosystem.</p><p>Just design a proposal that meets our requirements, submit to our forums, and wait for review by our grants committee. If your grant gets approved, you’re on your way to creating the next great project on the Sia storage network.</p><p>Check out <a href="https://sia.tech/grants">our site</a> for more info.</p><h3>The Current State of Grants</h3><p>The committee reviewed one new grant and checked in on the progress reports from all our existing grantees. We’ve also got another new one to take a look at, which arrived just late enough for the committee to need additional time to review.</p><h3>New Proposal: Rocket Web3 Game</h3><p><a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/technical-grant-application-web3-game-rocket-rocket/">Link</a></p><h4>What is it?</h4><p>A simple space game with a crypto marketplace and earnings system.</p><h4>Grant Status</h4><p>Not approved</p><h4>Updates</h4><p>Our first game idea had an interesting premise, but a lacking proposal. While the committee is open to reconsidering, the committee needed to better understand how Sia would be integrated, better budget justification, and a bit more detailed breakdown of the timeline and goals.</p><h3>Progress Reports</h3><p>When you accept a grant, you commit to update the Foundation and community once a month with a progress report detailing your work done, milestones you’ve met, and what you’ll work on next. Here’s a quick recap of some of the latest progress reports we’ve received from previous grantees.</p><h4>Fabstir</h4><p><a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/grant-proposal-fabstir/238/24">Link</a></p><ul><li>Set up local MiniKubes test media player/transcoder infrastructures.</li><li>Successfully uploaded a video to the media player cluster, which was then uploaded to S5.</li><li>Added authorization token functionality to the tus_client Rust native code, enabling Redsolver’s code snippet to upload files with authorization.</li></ul><h4>Alphaday</h4><p><a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/alphaday-is-a-powerful-crypto-workflow-aggregator-that-pulls-in-news-on-chain-data-social-media-web3-services-and-much-more-into-one-customizable-ui/251/9">Link</a></p><p>Alphaday is 99% complete, and the committee has been seeing internal versions prior to release. This will likely be our first fully complete grant.</p><h4>Lume Web</h4><p><a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/grant-proposal-lume-web/229/36">Link</a></p><ul><li>Handshake syncing and querying fully working in the browser</li><li>Significant work has been done on the DHT communication as well as the related client libraries that are used for DHT and DNS</li><li>Redundancy/resiliency and connection retries/reconnecting were added to the different layers up to the HNS module itself</li><li>Has started researching and implementing IPFS</li><li>Started on a website rebranding and redesign via contracting</li></ul><h4>Sia Satellite</h4><p><a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/grant-proposal-sia-satellite/240/14">Link</a></p><ul><li>Contracts can now be formed using renterd and the satellite</li><li>Able to lock a part of the balance when a contract is formed and unlocking it when it ends</li><li>Made some web portal improvements and bug fixes</li><li>Next: contract renewals and further integration with renterd</li></ul><h3>Coming Next</h3><p>We encourage the community to provide their feedback and ask questions on the <a href="https://forum.sia.tech/">Sia Forum</a>!

Work on our new releases has been progressing steadily — and we’re rapidly approaching the point where we’ll have betas of our new software available. As a non-dev with a bit of technical know-how, it’s an absolute pleasure to be able to see the progress that is coming from our dev team. This is the stuff that will define the direction of Sia for the next few years, and we hope that you’ll love the work that we’ve done (and remember that they are betas 🙂).</p><p>The Grants Program has been moving along well, with a steady stream of proposals from grant-hopefuls as well as internal process improvements on our end to keep things running smoothly. We’ll expand more on those process improvements in the next grants blog post — I’ve even been considering a separate post talking about how we run things over there.</p><p>Next month you’ll likely see some very minor changes to our quarterly report, but we’ll call those out when they happen.</p><p>And that’s enough exposition, let’s take a look at our work this month.</p><h3>Development</h3><p>All public repos can be found <a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation">here</a>.</p><h3>renterd</h3><p>renterd will be our new stand-alone renter. The renterd repo is currently public and can be found <a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/renterd">here</a>, and the app is expected to be released in beta by the end of Q1.</p><ul><li>Fixed a deadlock in the worker (<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/renterd/pull/139">Link</a>)</li><li>Fixed panics due to integer overflows (<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/renterd/pull/154">Link</a>)</li><li>Fixed ongoing uploads failing when contracts renew midway through (<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/renterd/pull/161">Link</a>)</li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*nml05oo60EUkFk157cJM1A.png" /></figure><ul><li>Support for MySQL (<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/renterd/pull/148">Link</a>)</li><li>MaxCollateral and RemainingStorage now play into host scores (<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/renterd/pull/151">Link</a>)</li><li>Added some leeway before we start migrating data to avoid excessive repairs (<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/renterd/pull/165">Link</a>)</li><li>Correctly handled SIGTERM to allow for graceful shutdowns in docker (<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/renterd/pull/174">Link</a>)</li><li>Autopilot now keeps Ephemeral Accounts filled (<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/renterd/pull/167">Link</a>)</li><li>Default gouging settings are a bit stricter now (<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/renterd/pull/160">Link</a>)</li><li>Added runtime profiling (<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/renterd/pull/134">Link</a>)</li><li>Added allowlist (selecting a pool of hosts to form contracts with) (<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/renterd/pull/155">Link</a>)</li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*BKXAkiE_gAn8UckTSk3fcQ.png" /></figure><ul><li>Improved renter shutdown handling (<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/renterd/pull/129">Link</a>)</li><li>Improved session timeout handling (<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/renterd/pull/144">Link</a>)</li><li>Added a seed command to generate a new recovery phrase (<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/renterd/pull/137">Link</a>)</li><li>Used ephemeral accounts for downloads</li><li>Extended documentation</li><li>Fixed a non-deterministic erasure coding bug which caused random panics</li></ul><h3>renterd UI</h3><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F804445319%3Fh%3D944214daff%26app_id%3D122963&amp;dntp=1&amp;display_name=Vimeo&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F804445319&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F1623875576-8eeda72c8d02917295c2028dfffe19e64cbee537dd8556e5efad5780bd9dca55-d_1280&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo" width="1628" height="1080" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/985e00fe1f083b9cc5ed94c742b876ef/href">https://medium.com/media/985e00fe1f083b9cc5ed94c742b876ef/href</a></iframe><ul><li>The contracts feature now shows a timeline visualization for active contracts</li><li>The contracts feature now shows and supports pagination and filtering active contracts.</li><li>Contracts are now filterable by expiry date.</li><li>Contracts are now filterable by renewal date.</li><li>The contracts filtering options are now accessible through the global cmd+k menu.</li><li>The Hosts feature now supports pagination and shows host info, scan, interaction, and uptime information.</li><li>The configuration page now includes the max storage price gouging setting.</li><li>The Autopilot settings were updated with the latest options including contract set.</li><li>The Files page now shows an onboarding/empty state when there are no files.</li></ul><h3>hostd</h3><p>hostd is the app you’ll be using to rent out your excess storage space to the Sia network.</p><ul><li>Added structured logging.

Previously, core had all of the bits and pieces required to perform Sia consensus, but it lacked an &quot;engine&quot; that could actually ingest blocks, apply the resulting state changes, and track the heaviest chain. This functionality was tested by successfully processing the full Sia blockchain (<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/core/pull/85">Link</a>)</li><li>Fixed math for computing new collateral upon renew in core (<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/core/pull/83">Link</a>)</li><li>Fixed some encoding/decoding issues in the (refactored) rhpv3 protocol (<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/core/pull/94">Link</a>)</li><li>Added Source to delayed outputs.

This is a small but important change that allows core to be used on the testnet (<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/core/pull/96">Link</a>)</li><li>Added testnet tax Hardfork override.

The Grants Program was created to fund research, development, developer tools, and anything else that will support and further our mission of user-owned data while enriching the Sia ecosystem.</p><p>Just design a proposal that meets our requirements, submit to our forums, and wait for review by our grants committee. If your grant gets approved, you’re on your way to creating the next great project on the Sia storage network.</p><p>Check out <a href="https://sia.tech/grants">our site</a> for more info.</p><h3>The Current State of Grants</h3><p>We’re continuing to see new and interesting proposals at a steady pace. Over the past month we reviewed four new submissions, approving one, declining another, requesting more information from the third, and recommending the final wait and re-propose at a later date.</p><p>The committee also made an important decision after approving Alphaday, a Sia news and on-chain data aggregator. They had committed to open source their data streams, but also asked about difficulties open-sourcing non-critical dev components like their front-end. The committee’s conclusion was the following: <strong>Projects can use closed-source components, but can’t develop closed-source code.</strong></p><p>This is of course subject to review and may change at a later date, but will serve as a target for us moving forward and will hopefully not relegate otherwise great (or fun!) projects to an unnecessary denial.</p><p>We’ve also added a <a href="https://sia.tech/grants#grant-applicant-faq">Grant FAQ</a> to our site to answer some common questions about the program.</p><h3>New Proposal: Messari Quarterly Reports</h3><p><a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/grant-proposal-messari-quarterly-reports/">Link</a></p><h4>What is it?</h4><blockquote>“We are proposing that Messari provide Sia with in-depth data analytics and research. This would serve to better inform existing stakeholders as well as attract new ones. while building out the open-source data infrastructure for the community.</blockquote><blockquote>These reports would live as free resources on Messari and would be distributed through our newsletter, social channels, and third-party distribution partners including Bloomberg, S&amp;P Global, and Refinitiv.”</blockquote><blockquote>-Messari</blockquote><h4>Grant Status</h4><p>Approved</p><h4>Updates</h4><p>The committee was very excited to have not just a research-centric proposal, but one from Messari. They agreed that these reports would benefit the ecosystem, and Messari has a large audience and a strong track record of doing thorough research.</p><p>Between the potentially massive reach of the reports, and the meticulous attention to detail for which Messari is known, these reports will provide an excellent resource for Sia community newcomers and veterans for years to come.</p><h3>New Proposal: Sia’s Arabic Library</h3><p><a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/sias-arabic-library/">Link</a></p><h4>What is it?</h4><p>Content creation and outreach for Arabic-speaking communities.</p><h4>Grant Status</h4><p>Declined</p><h4>Updates</h4><p>The committee was concerned with being able to assess the outcome without having anyone on the team who can speak the language, and our inability to continue serving whatever community might arise from this effort.</p><p>We actually receive requests for this type of work fairly often, but this was the first to come via a grant proposal. We love the idea of expanding the community reach of Sia and will consider if this is something we might want to move on in the future. This just wasn’t the right fit quite yet.</p><h3>New Proposal: Memory Gardens</h3><p><a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/grant-proposal-memory-gardens/">Link</a></p><h4>What is it?</h4><p>Secure, archivable service for all personal and individual content types.</p><h4>Grant Status</h4><p>More information requested</p><h4>Updates</h4><p>The committee is concerned about the lack of risk definition in the proposal. A risk identified by the committee was the need to hire developers for this project — having to onboard brand-new developer talent can be costly and time-consuming. Details regarding the ability of the current team to deliver would also be helpful, such as links to actual work done in the form of GitHub profiles or something else.</p><p>It seems like the team is currently developing on Arweave, and an understanding of the differences between Arweave and Sia would be an important consideration. The open source commitment is also unclear in the proposal. The idea seems very cool, and we’re excited to see if the Memory Gardens team can supply the requested info.</p><h3>New Proposal: Log Store</h3><p><a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/grant-proposal-log-store/">Link</a></p><h4>What is it?</h4><p>A decentralised event log storage solution that they want to integrate with the Sia network for storage of these event logs.</p><h4>Grant Status</h4><p>Recommended to re-submit at a later date</p><h4>Updates</h4><p>The Log Store team submitted an excellent, well-detailed proposal. Upon review, the committee requested more info from the team and was concerned about the timeline and existing state of development with the project and its Arweave integration.</p><p>The Log Store team responded and said that they can create a new grant proposal exclusively for the Sia storage module component of Log Store after the alpha has been released. The Grants Committee agreed with this and is looking forward to hearing from the Log Store team!</p><h3>Coming Next</h3><p>We already have a brand new proposal to take a look at during our next meeting. We encourage the community to provide their feedback and ask questions on the <a href="https://forum.sia.tech">Sia Forum</a> so the committee can gauge community interest and to help engage the applicant should they not come from the Sia ecosystem.</p><p>You can see the list of all proposals <a href="https://forum.sia.tech/c/foundation/grants/">here</a>, and our proposal requirements <a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/about-the-grants-category/">here</a>. See you next month!</p><h3>Steve</h3><p>steve#4381 on Discord</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=e351d31312af" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://blog.sia.tech/grants-program-update-february-2023-e351d31312af">Grants Program Update, February 2023</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.sia.tech">The Sia Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ykyrg9ydDNxLH6LSHbN8ZA.png" /></figure><p>We’re back with the State of Sia, a monthly installment looking at development and team updates for The Sia Foundation.</p><p>The holiday break didn’t slow us down at all. January was chock full of progress on our updated apps and new tools for the network. The Grants Program continued forward with new proposals and updates to our processes, and the Operations team settled into a number of process improvements.</p><h3>Development</h3><p>All public repos can be found <a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation">here</a>.</p><h3>Zen testnet</h3><p>We launched the first public Sia testnet, nicknamed “Zen.” Historically, we have relied on local testnets (e.g. Sia-Antfarm) for this purpose, but a public testnet gives us and other Sia developers a proving ground that is easier to use and more closely resembles the production network. We will be reaching out and partnering with long-time hosts to increase the available storage on the testnet. Software downloads for the Zen Testnet version of siad are now available <a href="https://sia.tech/get-started">here</a>. A testnet explorer and siacoin faucet are live <a href="https://zen.sia.tech/">here</a>.</p><h3>mainnet</h3><p>We have begun uploading and plan to maintain various public datasets on Sia to demonstrate the network’s storage capabilities. Metadata for these uploads will be publicly available on our website, allowing anyone to download the datasets using renterd. In total, we expect to upload around 2PB to the network.</p><h3>core</h3><p>The core repo is currently public and can be found <a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/core">here</a>.</p><ul><li>Converted renterd to use the new go.sia.tech/core types. This improves performance and will ease the transition to Utreexo. &lt;<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/core/pull/77">Code</a>&gt;</li></ul><h3>mux</h3><ul><li>Added v1 support to go.sia.tech/mux, allowing renterd and hostd to use this package and seamlessly upgrade to the v2 mux protocol when the peer supports it. &lt;<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/mux/commit/c3ab68bec66af815271efe5303aa4314d4664578">Code</a>&gt;</li></ul><h3>jape</h3><p>jape is what we use to check that the API routes between client/server are consistent</p><ul><li>Fixed some bugs. &lt;<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/jape/pull/9">Code</a>&gt; and &lt;<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/jape/pull/8">code</a>&gt;</li><li>Wrote Github Actions task to run the jape checker on our repositories. &lt;<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/action-golang-analysis">Code</a>&gt;, &lt;<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/renterd/pull/96">code</a>&gt;, &lt;<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/explorer/pull/5">code</a>&gt;, and &lt;<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/walletd/pull/9">code</a>&gt;</li></ul><h3>renterd</h3><p>renterd will be our new stand-alone renter. The renterd repo is currently public and can be found <a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/renterd">here</a>, and the app is expected to be released in beta by the end of Q1.</p><ul><li>renterd had a lot of bug fixing to make uploads faster</li><li>Working on a PR for basic Open Telemetry support</li><li>Automated wallet maintenance in the autopilot which speeds up contract creation quite well</li><li>Basic support for fetching price tables and funding ephemeral accounts, which is the groundwork for making downloads use ephemeral accounts for paying hosts</li><li>Merged contract locking, so multiple workers can safely download and upload from the same set of contracts</li><li>Added logging</li><li>Added Dockerfile</li><li>Added renewals</li><li>Added migrations</li><li>Added host blocklist</li><li>Added gouging checks</li><li>Improved performance (contractor/bus)</li><li>Fixed many of the bugs we introduced</li></ul><h4>renterd UI</h4><ul><li>The wallet now shows pending transactions</li><li>Added an upload manager that shows status and progress of each upload</li><li>Now supports logging in to remote servers</li><li>Now features an advanced configuration menu for gouging and redundancy settings</li><li>All forms now show settings that have been changed in green, and a summary count of changes next to the save action</li><li>Added a command palette for finding and interacting with any feature. The command palette can be launched with the ⌘+K hotkey</li></ul><h3>hostd</h3><p>hostd is the app you’ll be using to rent out your excess storage space to the Sia network.</p><ul><li>Added consistency checks to the volume manager. Hosts will be able to verify the data stored on disk matches the sector roots in their metadata</li><li>Refactor contract manager for faster startup. The contract manager now always subscribes to the most recent change in the consensus set on first startup. Contract actions are no longer tied to a specific height, but can occur at any height before the proof window closes</li><li>Change financial records to be atomically added alongside contract revisions. Fixes consistency issues between the financial manager and contract manager</li><li>Migrated from the internal mux implementation to go.sia.tech/mux -- a shared RHP3 package for hostd and renterd</li></ul><h3>walletd</h3><p>walletd will be the place to store your Siacoins.</p><ul><li>Fixed some issues identified by jape</li></ul><h3>website</h3><ul><li>The grants scoring rubric copy has been updated to be more specific</li><li>The Grants page now features FAQ sections for both applicants and grantees</li><li>All website page headings are now linkable</li><li>The website now allows users to find and download Zen Testnet siad builds from the getting started page</li><li>The website now features the full colored Sia logo in the site menus</li></ul><h3>explorer</h3><p><a href="https://explore.sia.tech">https://explore.sia.tech/</a></p><ul><li>The homepage now features host and storage metrics</li><li>The explorer now supports switching between networks — this was added to provide explorer functionality to the Zen Testnet</li><li>Fixed an issue where the block page title was displaying non-numeric block IDs as NaN</li><li>In testnet mode, the explorer now features a faucet for requesting Siacoin</li></ul><h3>Team Updates</h3><p>We are in the beginning stages of exploring a new role for the Foundation — one that isn’t uncommon in companies like ours, but also something we haven’t had here before. We’ll have more info next month on our plans regarding this position.</p><h3>Other Foundation Happenings</h3><h4>Advent of Code merch</h4><p>We’ve settled on a cool t-shirt design for Advent of Code participants, and they are currently in production.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YTFDFKm_U63bfzWlsH0VdQ.png" /></figure><p>This design riffs on the Advent of Code image and adds in the Sia logo front and center. These will be made available free for all AoC participants, and we expect them to be available starting the beginning of March.</p><p>It took us a while to get set up with a brand new merch vendor, but now that we are our next merch drop will be a bit more timely.</p><h3>Grants Program</h3><p>The Grants Program marches on with new proposals filing in since the beginning of the year. The committee approved our biggest grant yet, and we’re incredibly excited to fill you in during the next update over at <a href="https://blog.sia.tech/">blog.sia.tech</a>.</p><p>If you think you’ve got a great idea to benefit the Sia ecosystem, submit your proposal over at <a href="https://forum.sia.tech/">forum.sia.tech</a>.</p><h3>That’s all folks</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/710/1*UUUV6hsBIfO7qYzmUUJ96w.jpeg" /></figure><p>2023 is going to be a banner year for Sia and the Foundation, and we’re off to a great start already. Just scroll back up and take a look at all that development progress — our expanded team is moving forward with determination and a pace that we haven’t had before.</p><p>We’ll keep this momentum moving all throughout the year and capitalize on the opportunities given to us while we push to release our brand new apps.</p><p>Until next time!</p><p><a href="https://discord.gg/sia">Discord</a>, <a href="mailto:hello@sia.tech">Email</a></p><h3>Steve</h3><p>steve#4381 on Discord</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=ecaa78b356d6" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://blog.sia.tech/the-state-of-sia-february-2023-ecaa78b356d6">The State of Sia, February 2023</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.sia.tech">The Sia Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Grants Program was created to fund research, development, developer tools, and anything else that will support and further our mission of user-owned data while enriching the Sia ecosystem.</p><p>Just design a proposal that meets our requirements, submit to our forums, and wait for review by our grants committee. If your grant gets approved, you’re on your way to creating the next great project on the Sia storage network.</p><p>Check out <a href="https://sia.tech/grants">our site</a> for more info.</p><h3>The Current State of Grants</h3><p>2023 has been off to a great start with new grant proposals and progress reports for existing grants. We’ve been fortunate to approve one of those new proposals already, and plan to review the others on our normal schedule.</p><p>Every grantee must provide monthly progress reports, and the committee was pleased with the updates presented so far. These reports are an essential step in maintaining the transparency associated with the program and the dispersement of funds.</p><h3>Alphaday</h3><p><a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/alphaday-is-a-powerful-crypto-workflow-aggregator-that-pulls-in-news-on-chain-data-social-media-web3-services-and-much-more-into-one-customizable-ui/">Link</a></p><h4>What is it?</h4><p><strong>Alphaday</strong> is a Sia news, on-chain data, and social media aggregator.</p><h4>Grant Status</h4><p>Approved</p><h4>Updates</h4><p>Alphaday was a brand new proposal that presented us with a first-time challenge — development will require the project to use closed-source libraries or other components, while other critical components (and the new project code itself) will be open-source and transparent. This led to a new consideration for us, that we summarized as such:</p><blockquote>“Projects can use closed-source components, but can’t develop closed-source code.”</blockquote><p>Obviously, approval of proposals is still at the discretion of the committee, but this should give projects a little bit of flexibility in the future.</p><h3>Lume Web Progress Update</h3><p><a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/grant-proposal-lume-web/229/31">Link</a></p><h4>Grant Status</h4><p>In development</p><h4>Updates</h4><p>Derrick provided an incredibly extensive update for Lume Web, with links aplenty.</p><blockquote>Progress so far has been switching to the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/protomux">Protomux 1</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/protomux-rpc">Protomux-RPC</a> libraries and building a new RPC protocol based off of it from the original RPC design. This has the benefit of enabling any plugin to define a custom protocol due to the new PluginAPI.protocols</blockquote><p>Derrick also provides a statement of focus: web3 Hypercore P2P network and related ecosystem software, browser extension and related ecosystem software, educational and community Sites, and a new web portal software stack.</p><h3>Sia Satellite Progress Update</h3><p><a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/grant-proposal-sia-satellite/240/9">Link</a></p><h4>Grant Status</h4><p>In development</p><h4>Updates</h4><p>Courtesy of Mike, Sia Satellite sees significant progress as well, selecting a payment provider as well as sorting out account logistics.</p><blockquote>I had to change my initial planning and focus on the user accounts and the payment processing first. The users can now create accounts, log in, change their passwords, and delete their accounts if they like. When they log in, they are redirected to the dashboard (still work in progress) where they can see their balance and some Sia network averages and create a payment plan based on their storage requirements.</blockquote><p>What’s next for Sia Satellite? Adding a Stripe webhook to update the user balance after payment, followed by moving from test mode to live mode, moving HostDB from JSON to MySQL and optimizing the payment calculation, creating a command-line client to improve the control of the daemon, and moving on to form contracts with the hosts.</p><h3>Coming Next</h3><p>The committee has two other new proposals to review, including our first research-centric proposal which should give us something fun to talk about. We’re still really excited to see proposals continue to stream in, and are emboldened by the variety of each one. The program seems to be making progress towards its goal of enriching the Sia ecosystem.</p><p>You can see the list of all proposals <a href="https://forum.sia.tech/c/foundation/grants/">here</a>, and our proposal requirements <a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/about-the-grants-category/">here</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*De25D4TTugOxOZEQghDn5g.png" /></figure><p>We’re back with the State of Sia, a monthly installment looking at development and team updates for The Sia Foundation.</p><p>Welcome to 2023! A new year always stirs excitement for the future and reflection at what was accomplished the year prior. For an individual, it might be time to make that resolution a reality. For an organization, it’s time to re-align on goals and get ready for another year of forward progress.</p><p>When I joined the Foundation, there were just a few months left in 2022. Even within my short time here, I’m incredibly proud to see how much we’ve grown. Here’s a highlight reel of a few notable things the Foundation did throughout last year:</p><ul><li>got listed on <a href="https://web3index.org/sia">Web3Index</a></li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*l6eUKfFTgljFoq-rxvHq3g.png" /></figure><ul><li>released <a href="https://blog.sia.tech/escrowless-siafund-swaps-da418ed50df0">Embarcadero</a>, a tool for conducting escrowless Siafund/Siacoin swaps</li><li>completely redesigned <a href="https://sia.tech">sia.tech</a></li><li>released Sia v1.5.8 and v1.5.9</li><li>launched the <a href="https://sia.tech/grants">Grants Program</a>, and approved four of the eight initial proposals</li><li>brought on <a href="https://sia.tech/about-sia-foundation">three new hires</a> from Skynet Labs (hi!)</li><li>and most importantly, made lots of progress on our new apps for Sia — renterd, hostd, and walletd</li></ul><p>We made pretty big strides in terms of our development focus and organizational structure, and we intend to carry this into the new year. Before I get ahead of myself though, let’s take a walk through specific work done in the month of December.</p><h3>Development</h3><p>All public repos can be found <a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation">here</a>.</p><h4>core</h4><p>The core repo is currently public and can be found <a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/core">here</a>.</p><p>We implemented a modernized version of Sia’s consensus code. This will make syncing much faster, enable blockchain pruning, and greatly ease the transition to Utreexo. This code has not been merged yet; first, we need to run the new version alongside the old version while processing the entire blockchain, to ensure there are no discrepancies between the two.</p><p>Relevant code is <a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/core/tree/v1">here</a>.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*voALc9s_CJbD7iLgRd7MOQ.png" /></figure><h4>renterd</h4><p>renterd will be our new stand-alone renter. The renterd repo is currently public and can be found <a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/renterd">here</a>.</p><p>We worked on getting uploads, downloads, automatic contract formations and renewals (all functions of the autopilot) working in production and beyond our integration tests to allow for more expansive testing.</p><ul><li>Implemented upload + download HTTP endpoints in renterd, with support for range requests.</li></ul><blockquote>Note from Luke: Range requests are a feature of HTTP APIs that allows you to download “ranges” of data within a file, rather than having to download the entire thing. It’s a pretty basic feature, but an important one.</blockquote><ul><li>Added price gouging checks, though not quite finished. Although that’s not 100% finished yet</li><li>Next step is migrations (data repair)</li></ul><h4>hostd</h4><p>hostd is the app you’ll be using to rent out your excess storage space to the Sia network.</p><ul><li>Migrated API to SiaFoundation/jape, add missing endpoints from spec</li><li>Replaced us in integration tests with renterd</li><li>Added payout transactions to SingleAddressWallet</li><li>Replaced remaining ephemeral stores with SQLite stores</li><li>Replaced consensus module with chain manager</li></ul><h4>walletd</h4><p>walletd will be the place to store your Siacoins.</p><p>We ultimately decided not to go with the bitcoin coin selection algorithm because, after writing some simulation code, we found it was not much better from a fee minimization perspective than the random algorithm.</p><h4>skyrecover</h4><p>skyrecover is a set of utilities to recover lost skyd data. The skyrecover repo is currently public and can be found <a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/skyrecover">here</a>.</p><ul><li>Created a tool to search hosts for lost sectors using the Skynet file metadata</li><li>Created a tool to download lost sectors from hosts using the Skynet file metadata</li></ul><h4>Web/website</h4><p>The Sia Network Hosting Best Practices document has been added to the <a href="https://sia.tech/hosting-best-practices">website</a>. The Sia Foundation has prepared this document to provide high level guidance for using the Sia network. Our goal in doing so is not to provide legal advice, but to establish a set of common best practices for Hosts. This will help ensure the continued efficient functioning of the Sia network and enable Hosts and Renters alike to continue to realize its benefits.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*qk0jwCEqBcC6ASsTuiMDpw.png" /></figure><p>The Sia Foundation suggests that all Hosts know and follow these best practices. Please also check back to review these best practices, as we may update them from time to time.</p><p>We have updated the grants page to be a little more specific, and will soon add more useful information such as an FAQ section.</p><h4>Web/renterd</h4><p>We continued work on the renterd app and integrating the new bus and autopilot APIs across all features.</p><p>We built a React library for interacting with renterd&#39;s new bus and autopilot APIs. The library is a set of fully typed React hooks for fetching data and making mutations. The library will release along with the renterd app, and will be a convenient option for any developers looking to build UIs with the renterd APIs.</p><h3>Team Updates</h3><p>Our three newest hires have all settled into their new roles nicely. Chris and PJ found their footing immediately and set to work on various renterd tasks. I know the team really appreciates having more highly experienced Sia devs to share ideas and workload as we develop these powerful new apps.</p><p>I hope the Ops team is as happy about me joining the team as I am to be here! We’ve set to work on a few important things, like enacting new policies for the team and taking over project management for the Grants Program. My aim is always to help an organization marry efficiency and compassion, and I‘m proud to be part of a team here at the Foundation that strives for these goals.</p><h3>Other Foundation Happenings</h3><h4>Advent of Code</h4><p>Advent of Code presented a month of fun challenges, and we’re thankful to all participants. As mentioned last month, any participant who completed seven or more days will receive a prize from the team. We’ll have an announcement regarding the prize this week or early next. If you qualify, keep an eye on the #announcements channel in our <a href="https://discord.gg/sia">Discord server</a> for more info.</p><h4>Quarterly Report</h4><p>The <a href="https://sia.tech/transparency/2022-q4.pdf">Q4 2022 Transparency Report</a> has been published!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*TIlrbuX9_HpkhMAUpDuaOQ.png" /></figure><p>The Sia Foundation has grant funding available for community contributors! The Grants Program was created to fund research, development, developer tools, and anything else that will support and further our mission of user-owned data while enriching the Sia ecosystem.</p><p>Just design a proposal that meets our requirements, submit to our forums, and wait for review by our grants committee. If your grant gets approved, you’re on your way to creating the next great project on the Sia storage network.</p><p>Check out <a href="https://sia.tech/grants">our site</a> for more info.</p><h3>The Current State of Grants</h3><p>December saw a handful of new grant proposals and updates to existing ones. Unfortunately, due primarily to underdeveloped or unclear submissions, all new proposals have been rejected. The beauty of the program is that no rejection is forever, and a proposal can be updated after the initial rejection for future consideration.</p><h3>Fabstir</h3><p><a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/grant-proposal-fabstir/">Link</a></p><h4>What is it?</h4><p><strong>Fabstir is a Web3 platform</strong> for e-commerce, video and audio streaming, social media and governance for a fairer society.</p><h4>Grant Status</h4><p>Previously Approved</p><h4>Updates</h4><p>Fabstir was required to submit a clearer budget justification for their grant proposal, and this was accepted by the committee.</p><p>As we’ve seen multiple times already during the early stages of the Grants Program, more clarity has always been helpful to the decision-making of the Grants Committee. Anyone considering submitting a proposal should keep this in mind.</p><h3>Decentralized Feminine Health Data</h3><p><a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/decentralized-feminine-health-data/">Link</a></p><h4>What is it?</h4><p>An app designed to help women track their menstrual cycle and other health information without fear of government eavesdropping.</p><h4>Grant Status</h4><p>Rejected</p><h4>Updates</h4><p>I’ll editorialize for a moment here to say that I love the idea behind the project. I think it introduces a practical and user-focused application of Sia’s benefits.</p><p>However, DFHD was rejected by the committee for a number of reasons, including lack of risk identification, budget justification, definition of scope, and how Sia fit into the picture. A scarcity of communication in the original thread when questions were asked didn’t help make its case either, but as with all rejections the committee is happy to reconsider if the proposal is updated.</p><h3>Hype Squad</h3><p><a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/grant-proposal-hype-squad-dao-focused-on-education-in-web3/">Link</a></p><h4>What is it?</h4><p>A DAO focused on education in web3.</p><h4>Status</h4><p>Rejected</p><h4>Updates</h4><p>Education is always a virtuous pursuit, unfortunately this proposal lacks in many areas, including specifying how this proposal benefits Sia or the Foundation’s mission.</p><h3>CryptoChefs &amp; Cryptonaire</h3><p><a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/gamify-the-education-of-sia/">Link</a></p><h4>What is it?</h4><p>This project wants to gamify the education of Sia</p><h4>Status</h4><p>Rejected</p><h4>Updates</h4><p>This was rejected due to not identifying a meaningful impact on the Sia community, as well as apparently failing to meet the open source requirement.</p><h3>NearPay</h3><p><a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/grant-request-add-siacoin-to-nearpay-on-ramp-widget/">Link</a></p><h4>What is it?</h4><p>This grant would add Siacoin to the NearPay widget.</p><h4>Status</h4><p>Rejected</p><h4>Updates</h4><p>This grant proposal made it clear that code would not be open source, and seemed to be more fitting as an exchange discussion.</p><h3>Coming Next</h3><p>The committee might have a holiday lull here, as no new proposals are currently awaiting review. We’ve got some ideas in our back pocket to spur Grants Program growth as we head into next year.</p><p>You can see the list of all proposals <a href="https://forum.sia.tech/c/foundation/grants/">here</a>, and our proposal requirements <a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/about-the-grants-category/">here</a>. See you next month!</p><h3>Steve</h3><p>steve#4381 on Discord</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=f7be5f103d13" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://blog.sia.tech/grants-program-update-december-2022-f7be5f103d13">Grants Program Update, December 2022</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.sia.tech">The Sia Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The penultimate month of 2022 was filled with progress as we worked on major initiatives and welcomed new team members. You’ll hear about both shortly!</p><p>The first of these updates released last month and was received quite well in the community. We were incredibly pleased to see that. We want to better communicate the progress we make, and it seems like this update is shaping up to be a great first step towards that goal.</p><p>We could also <a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1586127052767318016/photo/1">print out the code</a> and send it to you, but we’ll stick with this method for now.</p><h3>Development</h3><h4>renterd</h4><p>renterd will be our new stand-alone renter.</p><p>Significant progress continues on the new renterd. A meeting of the minds for the three developers involved resulted in an architectural overhaul of the app. renterd will now consist of three components: worker, bus, and autopilot (names could change). <a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/renterd/pull/16">Here&#39;s the PR</a>, and here’s the tl;dr:</p><p>bus is the source of the truth for the stuff, worker does the stuff, and autopilot makes all the stuff happen easily. “Stuff” in this case of course being the litany of contract formations, blockchain checking, downloads, and other work that any particular instance of Sia used for renting must do.</p><p>This architecture allows renterd to scale horizontally (important for third party use), and will let our devs work mostly independently as they each tackle a component.</p><p>renterd also saw continued work on its UI, primarily related to the new autopilot system, and designing it into the host and contracts features.</p><p>Some specific bits added to autopilot this month included:</p><ul><li>an initial autopilot loop</li><li>a contractor</li><li>a host scanner</li><li>host filtering and scoring</li><li>migrated the backend (object store, contract store and hostdb) over to a SQL database</li><li>currently working on object repairs in the autopilot</li><li>building a test suite for integration tests</li></ul><p>For worker, contributions were made to host metrics.</p><h4>hostd</h4><p>hostd is the app you’ll be using to rent out your excess storage space to the Sia network.</p><ul><li>Refactored the financial manager</li><li>Fixed accounting issues related to ephemeral accounts</li><li>Refactored the MDM executor</li><li>Added financial tracking to all income sources for RHP2 and RHP3</li><li>Migrated financial store and contract metadata store to SQLite from BadgerDB. Tested a wallet store with SQLite.</li><li>Added integration tests for financials</li><li>Additional consistency tests for siad renters</li></ul><h4>skyrecover</h4><p>skyrecover is a set of utilities to recover lost skyd data.</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/skyrecover/commit/1b4ee10d757df0efdac09349349699a2bb99f962">Fix issue recovering small files</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/skyrecover/commit/97ad97319f3c536999ac877f591e45bcd6fb4921">Added tool to scan base sectors for a specific checksum</a></li></ul><h4>walletd</h4><p>walletd will be the place to store your Siacoins.</p><p>We worked on making the jape API checker <a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/jape/pull/5">more robust</a>. These checks prevent a common developer error where more than one HTTP response is sent.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/walletd/pull/8">This PR</a> added the bitcoin coin selection and the single random draw selection algorithm to the walletd rewrite. We’re now working on simulating past transactions to see which algorithm is more efficient in terms of minimizing fees.</p><h4>web</h4><p>We refactored styling across the Sia design system and apps, migrating all code to Tailwind, a popular CSS framework. Tailwind’s widespread use amongst developers will make future contributions to Sia’s UI code easier. We also updated the website to be more optimized for mobile layouts (and other minor updates to content).</p><h3>Team Updates</h3><p>Chris joined the team in November! To say this is a great pick up for the Foundation is an understatement. Coming from Skynet Labs, Chris has been working on Sia for longer than anyone except for Sia’s co-founders Luke and David. He brings intimate knowledge of the codebase and wonderful new ideas to the team.</p><p>Here’s what Luke had to say about Chris joining the Sia Foundation.</p><blockquote>We have another exciting addition to announce: Chris has joined the Foundation! Chris really needs no introduction; he discovered Sia in the early days of the project, and has been making enormously valuable contributions ever since, spanning nearly the entire codebase. Needless to say, I’m very pleased to have him aboard to lend his experience and passion to renterd, Utreexo, and beyond. Welcome! :)</blockquote><blockquote><em>- Luke Champine, President and Core Developer of The Sia Foundation</em></blockquote><p>This is our last new hire for 2022. With three recent pick ups to add to an already excellent team, the Sia Foundation is well-positioned to rocket into 2023.</p><h3>Other Foundation Happenings</h3><h4>Advent of Code</h4><p>Advent of Code returns for 2022! AoC is a daily code challenge that can test your skills in fun and interesting ways. Join our private leaderboard using code 30280-c51e2e3e. Anyone who completes at least seven days will receive a prize (to be determined) from the Foundation!</p><h4>Quarterly update</h4><p>We’re working on our latest Quarterly Update, which you’ll see posted via our socials on January 1, 2023. Be sure to check out our previous updates over on <a href="https://sia.tech/about-sia-foundation">our website</a>.</p><p>These updates are an important part of the transparency that we promote here, giving our community insight into our highlighted work, financials, and future plans.</p><h4>Grants Program</h4><p>The Grants Program is finding its stride, allowing for community members to get funds for their Sia-related project. We recently published our first <a href="https://blog.sia.tech/grants-program-update-november-2022-83dd4a7e266e">Grants Program update</a>, detailing the first two grants that we’ve approved. This will be a new monthly post that you can check over at <a href="https://blog.sia.tech">blog.sia.tech</a> to find out the latest grant happenings.</p><p>We’re absolutely thrilled to be seeing new proposals dropping into the forum. If you think you’ve got a great idea to benefit the Sia ecosystem, submit your proposal over at <a href="https://forum.sia.tech">forum.sia.tech</a>.</p><h3>That’s all folks</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/710/0*PGPgZLGigMIJP6VN.jpeg" /></figure><p>Thanks for another great month! As we move toward the end of the year, we’re thankful for such a wonderful community. 2023 will see great things for the Sia Foundation, but we’re not through with 2022 yet.

The Grants Program was created to fund research, development, developer tools, and anything else that will support and further our mission of user-owned data while enriching the Sia ecosystem.</p><p>Just design a proposal that meets our requirements, submit to our forums, and wait for review by our grants committee. If your grant gets approved, you’re on your way to creating the next great project on the Sia storage network.</p><p>Check out <a href="https://sia.tech/grants">our site</a> for more info.</p><h3>The Current State of Grants</h3><p>We launched the Grants Program two months ago, and in that time have reviewed three grant proposals. A couple more just dropped this week, but we’ll have more info on those later.</p><p>Two have been conditionally approved, and the third is awaiting some updates to the proposal. All three have potential to add great new features and tools to the Sia ecosystem, and we’re excited to see them develop as we move forward.</p><p>Let’s take a look at the two approved grants.</p><h4>Lume Web</h4><p>Status: <strong>Approved</strong></p><p>Lume Web is a project that aims to “unify the dWeb” and make strides towards a better web3. With plans for a Firefox browser extension for viewing web3 content, building upon his third party Skynet portal, and creating new educational sites for this new tech, Lume Web wants to be a major player in the still developing space. Longer term goals include a custom web browser and becoming the open hub for web3.</p><p>Derrick Hammer, Lume’s developer, plans to accomplish these goals throughout 2023. Here’s what Derrick had to say about Lume and his grant:</p><blockquote>I believe Lume is going to be the center hub of web3 and this is giving me a once in a lifetime opportunity to build an open ecosystem and have the community support me.</blockquote><blockquote>Simply put: Lume Web is web3 for the masses. Web1 was AOL, Web2 is Google, and Web3 will be Lume 🙃</blockquote><h4>Sia Satellite</h4><p>Status: <strong>Approved</strong></p><p>Sia Satellite wants to cut down barriers to entry. Currently, someone who wants to use Sia needs to get Siacoins in order to form contracts and pay the hosts who store their data. Sia Satellite will serve as an intermediary who handles all the complicated blockchain and contract stuff, leaving the user to pay for their storage easily with a credit card.</p><p>Developer Michael Bulanov submitted an ambitious proposal on a six month time line, and the grants committee recommended splitting up work into multiple parts/grants for more focused progress.</p><p>Mike is also a Sia Grants Committee member, and was therefore excluded from the discussion and approval process for Sia Satellite. He kept it simple when asked how he felt after his proposal was approved:</p><blockquote>Well, how do I feel… I feel, like, WOW!, I seem to have gone up to the next level of personal development.</blockquote><h3>Coming Next</h3><p>The committee has two new grants to sort through, and one to review updates for. We’re incredibly excited to have so many new opportunities to expand the Sia ecosystem with these wonderful community projects.</p><p>You can see the list of all proposals <a href="https://forum.sia.tech/c/foundation/grants/">here</a>, and our proposal requirements <a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/about-the-grants-category/">here</a>. See you next month!</p><h4>p.s.</h4><p>Want to see more next update? Should we talk about all active proposals instead of just the current list of approved ones?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*P8rQ82pVc5_b690s_JhZNw.png" /></figure><p>Hello Sia community! Welcome to the first State of Sia, a new monthly installment looking at development and team updates for The Sia Foundation.</p><p>We decided that — considering the size of the team and dev manpower — these should be released once a month. That could easily change as we develop more sophisticated project management and bring on new talent, but you can expect that cadence for the first few iterations here.</p><p>Speaking of iterations, things might change month-to-month as we find our stride and gather community feedback on how best to present this info.</p><p>Finally, some of our repos are still private. For those that remember the many PR links of the Sia dev updates back in the pre-Skynet Labs days, know that we’ll re-instate those as we begin to make these repos public over the coming weeks and months.</p><p>That’s enough from me, so let’s get on with it!</p><h3>Development</h3><p>Let’s take a look at the progress of each major development initiative and what to expect moving forward.</p><h4>Our next-gen apps</h4><p>The current Sia-UI and siad let you interact with all of Sia in one app, but part of our updates to these will be splitting functionality into multiple separate programs. We know from years of experience that having everything together under a single roof results in a lot of dead weight for a vast majority of users. Even folks who do need it all usually use a separate instance for each use case. A quick example of this is that they might not want their long term siacoin storage intermingled with their renting funds, but there are lots of other scenarios that we hope to accommodate with this change.</p><p>Splitting everything up will result in three new apps: renterd for purchasing storage space to upload files, hostd for renting out your excess storage space to renters, and walletd if all you need to do is to hold siacoins somewhere safe.</p><h4>renterd</h4><p>renterd will be our new stand-alone renter. As with each next-gen app, there will be a UI client as well as the essential CLI version.</p><ul><li>Implemented parallel transfer algorithms for uploading, downloading, and migrating sector data (<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/renterd/commit/817effb2d53d718a7c5f0f8369ff8f7ffcc0a300">Link</a>). This was an important function that allows renterd to behave like a good renter should and run lots of different tasks simultaneously.</li><li>Fixed deadlock + nil panic bugs, located courtesy of our most recent dev hire PJ!</li><li>Finished initial autopilot design and began work on host scanning/ranking. Autopilot is a critical feature that lets a renter get used by a non-developer. It automatically ranks hosts, forms contracts, and migrates (repairs) file data, and is by far the most complicated part of any renter.</li><li>Fixed a bug in renterd causing the object store to not be persisted</li><li>Worked on contract and host management UI features for renterd, leveraging much of last month’s work on similar features for hostd. Focused on consistency across renterd and hostd features, so all features feel familiar and follow the same user workflows</li></ul><h4>hostd</h4><p>hostd is the app you’ll be using to rent out your excess storage space to the Sia network.</p><ul><li>Finished reimplementing the MDM, accounts, registry, and RHP3 for hostd</li><li>Finished a test RHP3 renter for hostd</li><li>Built out the single address wallet module that is used in both the renterd and hostd UI applications. The wallet features an intuitive wizard and supports multiple currencies</li></ul><h4>walletd</h4><p>Finally, walletd will be the place to store your Siacoins.</p><ul><li>Added a JSON store and tests to preserve wallet data</li><li>Added an API test</li><li>Changed walletd’s API to use the jape framework instead of httprouter</li><li>Added hot and read-only wallet tests</li></ul><h4>web</h4><p>We made a series of updates to the website, including <a href="https://sia.tech/grants">the new grants page</a> where community members can learn how to get funding for their projects.</p><p>Website updates also include <a href="https://sia.tech/software/renterd">the new </a><a href="https://sia.tech/software/renterd">renterd landing page</a> which features screenshots of all the above mentioned work — so it’s another great place to stay up to date on the new renterd software! A similar page for hostd is coming soon.</p><h4>Stray dev bits</h4><ul><li>Built a utility to recover lost Skynet data using the file metadata</li></ul><h3>Team Updates</h3><p>PJ Brone joined the dev team in October, bringing his talents and extensive Sia ecosystem knowledge directly from Skynet Labs. Interestingly, PJ is one of the few devs on the former Skynet Labs team to have actually worked on Sia. Here’s what Luke had to say about PJ joining the team.</p><blockquote>PJ is a veteran of the Sia ecosystem and has a clear passion for writing high-quality code. He’ll be working with me directly on <em>renterd</em> and other core dev projects, which will be a big help. PJ is super friendly, hard-working, and deeply interested in making Sia a better platform for everyone.
