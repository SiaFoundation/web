            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*kuga5l3H6VLUyE03d7stqg.png" /></figure><p>We’re back with the State of Sia, a monthly installment looking at development and team updates for The Sia Foundation.</p><p>And so ends the first quarter of 2023. In a feat of being Technically Correct, we have indeed released the renterd <a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/renterd/releases/tag/v0.1.0-beta">beta</a> that we’ve been chatting about for a while, right on time in the late hours of March 31st :)</p><p>Featuring new architecture that the dev team has been working incredibly hard on, and a beautiful re-imagined UI/UX from Alex, this is our first step towards the future of the Foundation. Our newly-built apps for renting, hosting, and wallet functions will continue to march towards full releases. The plan right now is to have a hostd beta, and a renterd full release, in the coming months.</p><p>We can’t wait for you to try them out.</p><p>Switching gears, a recent development affecting the Sia ecosystem was the announcement from Bittrex that they are shutting down US operations, with the last full day to withdraw your funds being April 29, 2023. We’ve put together a brief guide for navigating this, as well as what it means for the broader Sia network, <a href="https://blog.sia.tech/psa-bittrex-is-shutting-down-5a6d9e8df44a">here</a>.</p><p>Finally, while we mention this later I want to call something out right now. We’ve updated sia.tech with a new roadmap for the Foundation’s work. This is a mid to high level look at core Sia development, both current and future. It focuses on the big projects we’re working on, what we’ve got planned next, and includes an activity feed from all of our public repos.</p><p>It will be updated at least once a quarter to reflect changes in our priorities or to recognize significant accomplishments. This roadmap is important for a few reasons — it’s something easy to point new users, potential partners, and exchanges to. The activity feed gives a quick look at development that might otherwise fly under the radar. And it just looks really cool. Check it out over at <a href="https://sia.tech/roadmap">sia.tech/roadmap</a>.</p><p>I was personally really impressed with how quickly we put this together. What started out as a tentative request in an informal meeting turned into something real, and significant, in less than two weeks. And that’s with a whole bunch of other important things going on.</p><p>That’ll do it for me, let’s get on to the good stuff.</p><h3>Development</h3><p>All public repos can be found <a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation">here</a>.</p><h3>renterd</h3><p>renterd will be our new stand-alone renter.

I never miss an opportunity to remind folks — not your keys, not your crypto. Keeping cryptocurrency in an exchange wallet is one of the easiest ways to lose it. Fortunately, Bittrex has provided ample time for you to transfer your funds, so make use of this opportunity.</p><h3>A little closer to home</h3><p>Now that that’s out of the way, I’d like to talk about how this affects The Sia Foundation and our users.</p><p>The loss of Bittrex is an unfortunate event for Sia users in the United States. Bittrex provided a reliable way to get Siacoins so users could use them for their purpose of purchasing and renting storage on the Sia network. It was also the second largest exchange for trading Siacoins by daily volume, so a not-insignificant amount of users will be affected.<br> <br>Fortunately, Kraken is still available for US users. Kraken is consistently the most-used US exchange for trading Siacoins by daily volume, and has been a reputable resource for the community. For now, we recommend that Sia users in the US create a Kraken account for acquiring Siacoins to rent storage.</p><p>The Foundation is also looking into options to expand the footprint of US exchanges that offer Siacoins. We’ll have more info on this as it becomes available.</p><h3>Links and info</h3><p>Learn how to set up our <a href="https://docs.sia.tech/your-sia-wallet/sia-ui-faqs/how-to-make-a-new-wallet-in-sia-ui">official Sia wallet</a>, and follow these steps to <a href="https://docs.sia.tech/your-sia-wallet/how-to-make-a-sia-address">make an address</a> to transfer your Siacoins over.</p><p>A full timeline of the Bittrex shutdown can be found <a href="https://bittrex.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/10080271948701">here</a>.</p><p>For any other questions, please reach out in our <a href="https://discord.gg/sia">Discord</a>.</p><p><em>Sia is a blockchain-based storage network that allows users to store their files in a fully decentralized way that is safer and less expensive than traditional centralized options.</em></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=5a6d9e8df44a" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://blog.sia.tech/psa-bittrex-is-shutting-down-5a6d9e8df44a">PSA: Bittrex is shutting down US operations</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.sia.tech">The Sia Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Grants Program was created to fund research, development, developer tools, and anything else that will support and further our mission of user-owned data while enriching the Sia ecosystem.</p><p>Just design a proposal that meets our requirements, submit to our forums, and wait for review by our grants committee. If your grant gets approved, you’re on your way to creating the next great project on the Sia storage network.</p><p>Check out <a href="https://sia.tech/grants">our site</a> for more info.</p><h3>The Current State of Grants</h3><p>The committee reviewed one new grant and checked in on the progress reports from all our existing grantees. We’ve also got another new one to take a look at, which arrived just late enough for the committee to need additional time to review.</p><h3>New Proposal: Rocket Web3 Game</h3><p><a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/technical-grant-application-web3-game-rocket-rocket/">Link</a></p><h4>What is it?</h4><p>A simple space game with a crypto marketplace and earnings system.</p><h4>Grant Status</h4><p>Not approved</p><h4>Updates</h4><p>Our first game idea had an interesting premise, but a lacking proposal. While the committee is open to reconsidering, the committee needed to better understand how Sia would be integrated, better budget justification, and a bit more detailed breakdown of the timeline and goals.</p><h3>Progress Reports</h3><p>When you accept a grant, you commit to update the Foundation and community once a month with a progress report detailing your work done, milestones you’ve met, and what you’ll work on next. Here’s a quick recap of some of the latest progress reports we’ve received from previous grantees.</p><h4>Fabstir</h4><p><a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/grant-proposal-fabstir/238/24">Link</a></p><ul><li>Set up local MiniKubes test media player/transcoder infrastructures.</li><li>Successfully uploaded a video to the media player cluster, which was then uploaded to S5.</li><li>Added authorization token functionality to the tus_client Rust native code, enabling Redsolver’s code snippet to upload files with authorization.</li></ul><h4>Alphaday</h4><p><a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/alphaday-is-a-powerful-crypto-workflow-aggregator-that-pulls-in-news-on-chain-data-social-media-web3-services-and-much-more-into-one-customizable-ui/251/9">Link</a></p><p>Alphaday is 99% complete, and the committee has been seeing internal versions prior to release.

Community contribution and input is the best way to push proposals and projects to the next level.</p><p>You can see the list of all proposals <a href="https://forum.sia.tech/c/foundation/grants/">here</a>, and our proposal requirements <a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/about-the-grants-category/">here</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*EzR6UZBxPS3rvOplNqqbew.png" /></figure><p>We’re back with the State of Sia, a monthly installment looking at development and team updates for The Sia Foundation.</p><p>As we head into the end of Q1, we’re moving towards an important time for the Foundation. Work on our new releases has been progressing steadily — and we’re rapidly approaching the point where we’ll have betas of our new software available. As a non-dev with a bit of technical know-how, it’s an absolute pleasure to be able to see the progress that is coming from our dev team. This is the stuff that will define the direction of Sia for the next few years, and we hope that you’ll love the work that we’ve done (and remember that they are betas 🙂).</p><p>The Grants Program has been moving along well, with a steady stream of proposals from grant-hopefuls as well as internal process improvements on our end to keep things running smoothly. We’ll expand more on those process improvements in the next grants blog post — I’ve even been considering a separate post talking about how we run things over there.</p><p>Next month you’ll likely see some very minor changes to our quarterly report, but we’ll call those out when they happen.</p><p>And that’s enough exposition, let’s take a look at our work this month.</p><h3>Development</h3><p>All public repos can be found <a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation">here</a>.</p><h3>renterd</h3><p>renterd will be our new stand-alone renter. The renterd repo is currently public and can be found <a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/renterd">here</a>, and the app is expected to be released in beta by the end of Q1.</p><ul><li>Fixed a deadlock in the worker (<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/renterd/pull/139">Link</a>)</li><li>Fixed panics due to integer overflows (<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/renterd/pull/154">Link</a>)</li><li>Fixed ongoing uploads failing when contracts renew midway through (<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/renterd/pull/161">Link</a>)</li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*nml05oo60EUkFk157cJM1A.png" /></figure><ul><li>Support for MySQL (<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/renterd/pull/148">Link</a>)</li><li>MaxCollateral and RemainingStorage now play into host scores (<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/renterd/pull/151">Link</a>)</li><li>Added some leeway before we start migrating data to avoid excessive repairs (<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/renterd/pull/165">Link</a>)</li><li>Correctly handled SIGTERM to allow for graceful shutdowns in docker (<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/renterd/pull/174">Link</a>)</li><li>Autopilot now keeps Ephemeral Accounts filled (<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/renterd/pull/167">Link</a>)</li><li>Default gouging settings are a bit stricter now (<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/renterd/pull/160">Link</a>)</li><li>Added runtime profiling (<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/renterd/pull/134">Link</a>)</li><li>Added allowlist (selecting a pool of hosts to form contracts with) (<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/renterd/pull/155">Link</a>)</li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*BKXAkiE_gAn8UckTSk3fcQ.png" /></figure><ul><li>Improved renter shutdown handling (<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/renterd/pull/129">Link</a>)</li><li>Improved session timeout handling (<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/renterd/pull/144">Link</a>)</li><li>Added a seed command to generate a new recovery phrase (<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/renterd/pull/137">Link</a>)</li><li>Used ephemeral accounts for downloads</li><li>Extended documentation</li><li>Fixed a non-deterministic erasure coding bug which caused random panics</li></ul><h3>renterd UI</h3><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F804445319%3Fh%3D944214daff%26app_id%3D122963&amp;dntp=1&amp;display_name=Vimeo&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F804445319&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F1623875576-8eeda72c8d02917295c2028dfffe19e64cbee537dd8556e5efad5780bd9dca55-d_1280&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo" width="1628" height="1080" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/985e00fe1f083b9cc5ed94c742b876ef/href">https://medium.com/media/985e00fe1f083b9cc5ed94c742b876ef/href</a></iframe><ul><li>The contracts feature now shows a timeline visualization for active contracts</li><li>The contracts feature now shows and supports pagination and filtering active contracts.</li><li>Contracts are now filterable by expiry date.</li><li>Contracts are now filterable by renewal date.</li><li>The contracts filtering options are now accessible through the global cmd+k menu.</li><li>The Hosts feature now supports pagination and shows host info, scan, interaction, and uptime information.</li><li>The configuration page now includes the max storage price gouging setting.</li><li>The Autopilot settings were updated with the latest options including contract set.</li><li>The Files page now shows an onboarding/empty state when there are no files.</li></ul><h3>hostd</h3><p>hostd is the app you’ll be using to rent out your excess storage space to the Sia network.</p><ul><li>Added structured logging.

This allows renterd and hostd (and any other project) to share a single implementation of the RHP, rather than maintaining separate, possibly-incompatible versions (<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/core/pull/79">Link</a>)</li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*VvFZZZ48jkI9eGW9ekjsiQ.png" /></figure><ul><li>Fixed compatibility issues between core and siad.

Previously, core had all of the bits and pieces required to perform Sia consensus, but it lacked an &quot;engine&quot; that could actually ingest blocks, apply the resulting state changes, and track the heaviest chain. This functionality was tested by successfully processing the full Sia blockchain (<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/core/pull/85">Link</a>)</li><li>Fixed math for computing new collateral upon renew in core (<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/core/pull/83">Link</a>)</li><li>Fixed some encoding/decoding issues in the (refactored) rhpv3 protocol (<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/core/pull/94">Link</a>)</li><li>Added Source to delayed outputs. This makes it easier for wallets and explorers to display non-transactions like contract payouts (<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/core/pull/87">Link</a>)</li><li>Added support for testnet constants in core. This is a small but important change that allows core to be used on the testnet (<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/core/pull/96">Link</a>)</li><li>Added testnet tax Hardfork override. Enables hostd and renterd testnet builds (<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/core/pull/95">Link</a>)</li><li>Added some consensus tests after core was updated (<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/core/pull/88">Link</a>)</li></ul><h3>docs</h3><ul><li>Add linux setup guide for hosts (<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/docs/pull/5">Link</a>)</li></ul><h3>jape</h3><p>jape is what we use to check that the API routes between client/server are consistent.</p><ul><li>Added support for strings in query parameters.

After approving Messari’s grant and recommending that Log Store re-apply at a later date, the committee recently reviewed another two, with a third and fourth on the docket for this week. The committee approved our biggest grant yet, and we’re incredibly excited to fill you with the latest update over at <a href="https://blog.sia.tech/">blog.sia.tech</a>.</p><p>Our Grants Program page on sia.tech was also updated to include a <a href="https://sia.tech/grants#grant-applicant-faq">Grantee FAQ</a> to answer some common questions that might come up during and after your grant proposal.</p><p>If you think you’ve got a great idea to benefit the Sia ecosystem, submit your proposal over at <a href="https://forum.sia.tech/">forum.sia.tech</a>.</p><h3>That’s all folks</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/710/0*p8zPGQwXkEmdXD96.jpeg" /></figure><p>As we look towards the end of Q1 and the beginning of Q2, we can be proud of the quiet progress we’ve made. The growth of our grants program, the focus on scalability in our new apps, and the quality of both our team and community are all we need to continue driving to success.</p><p>Until next time!</p><p><a href="https://discord.gg/sia">Discord</a>, <a href="mailto:hello@sia.tech">Email</a></p><h3>Steve</h3><p>steve#4381 on Discord</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=6564463e35c0" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://blog.sia.tech/the-state-of-sia-march-2023-6564463e35c0">The State of Sia, March 2023</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.sia.tech">The Sia Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_E4mT3dxjpGaGRw2x_kSSg.png" /></figure><p>The Sia Foundation has grant funding available for community contributors! The Grants Program was created to fund research, development, developer tools, and anything else that will support and further our mission of user-owned data while enriching the Sia ecosystem.</p><p>Just design a proposal that meets our requirements, submit to our forums, and wait for review by our grants committee. If your grant gets approved, you’re on your way to creating the next great project on the Sia storage network.</p><p>Check out <a href="https://sia.tech/grants">our site</a> for more info.</p><h3>The Current State of Grants</h3><p>We’re continuing to see new and interesting proposals at a steady pace. Over the past month we reviewed four new submissions, approving one, declining another, requesting more information from the third, and recommending the final wait and re-propose at a later date.</p><p>The committee also made an important decision after approving Alphaday, a Sia news and on-chain data aggregator. They had committed to open source their data streams, but also asked about difficulties open-sourcing non-critical dev components like their front-end. The committee’s conclusion was the following: <strong>Projects can use closed-source components, but can’t develop closed-source code.</strong></p><p>This is of course subject to review and may change at a later date, but will serve as a target for us moving forward and will hopefully not relegate otherwise great (or fun!) projects to an unnecessary denial.</p><p>We’ve also added a <a href="https://sia.tech/grants#grant-applicant-faq">Grant FAQ</a> to our site to answer some common questions about the program.</p><h3>New Proposal: Messari Quarterly Reports</h3><p><a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/grant-proposal-messari-quarterly-reports/">Link</a></p><h4>What is it?</h4><blockquote>“We are proposing that Messari provide Sia with in-depth data analytics and research. This would serve to better inform existing stakeholders as well as attract new ones. while building out the open-source data infrastructure for the community.</blockquote><blockquote>These reports would live as free resources on Messari and would be distributed through our newsletter, social channels, and third-party distribution partners including Bloomberg, S&amp;P Global, and Refinitiv.”</blockquote><blockquote>-Messari</blockquote><h4>Grant Status</h4><p>Approved</p><h4>Updates</h4><p>The committee was very excited to have not just a research-centric proposal, but one from Messari. They agreed that these reports would benefit the ecosystem, and Messari has a large audience and a strong track record of doing thorough research.</p><p>Between the potentially massive reach of the reports, and the meticulous attention to detail for which Messari is known, these reports will provide an excellent resource for Sia community newcomers and veterans for years to come.</p><h3>New Proposal: Sia’s Arabic Library</h3><p><a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/sias-arabic-library/">Link</a></p><h4>What is it?</h4><p>Content creation and outreach for Arabic-speaking communities.</p><h4>Grant Status</h4><p>Declined</p><h4>Updates</h4><p>The committee was concerned with being able to assess the outcome without having anyone on the team who can speak the language, and our inability to continue serving whatever community might arise from this effort.</p><p>We actually receive requests for this type of work fairly often, but this was the first to come via a grant proposal. We love the idea of expanding the community reach of Sia and will consider if this is something we might want to move on in the future. This just wasn’t the right fit quite yet.</p><h3>New Proposal: Memory Gardens</h3><p><a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/grant-proposal-memory-gardens/">Link</a></p><h4>What is it?</h4><p>Secure, archivable service for all personal and individual content types.</p><h4>Grant Status</h4><p>More information requested</p><h4>Updates</h4><p>The committee is concerned about the lack of risk definition in the proposal. A risk identified by the committee was the need to hire developers for this project — having to onboard brand-new developer talent can be costly and time-consuming. Details regarding the ability of the current team to deliver would also be helpful, such as links to actual work done in the form of GitHub profiles or something else.</p><p>It seems like the team is currently developing on Arweave, and an understanding of the differences between Arweave and Sia would be an important consideration. The open source commitment is also unclear in the proposal. The idea seems very cool, and we’re excited to see if the Memory Gardens team can supply the requested info.</p><h3>New Proposal: Log Store</h3><p><a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/grant-proposal-log-store/">Link</a></p><h4>What is it?</h4><p>A decentralised event log storage solution that they want to integrate with the Sia network for storage of these event logs.</p><h4>Grant Status</h4><p>Recommended to re-submit at a later date</p><h4>Updates</h4><p>The Log Store team submitted an excellent, well-detailed proposal. Upon review, the committee requested more info from the team and was concerned about the timeline and existing state of development with the project and its Arweave integration.</p><p>The Log Store team responded and said that they can create a new grant proposal exclusively for the Sia storage module component of Log Store after the alpha has been released. The Grants Committee agreed with this and is looking forward to hearing from the Log Store team!</p><h3>Coming Next</h3><p>We already have a brand new proposal to take a look at during our next meeting. We encourage the community to provide their feedback and ask questions on the <a href="https://forum.sia.tech">Sia Forum</a> so the committee can gauge community interest and to help engage the applicant should they not come from the Sia ecosystem.</p><p>You can see the list of all proposals <a href="https://forum.sia.tech/c/foundation/grants/">here</a>, and our proposal requirements <a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/about-the-grants-category/">here</a>. See you next month!</p><h3>Steve</h3><p>steve#4381 on Discord</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=e351d31312af" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://blog.sia.tech/grants-program-update-february-2023-e351d31312af">Grants Program Update, February 2023</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.sia.tech">The Sia Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

January was chock full of progress on our updated apps and new tools for the network. The Grants Program continued forward with new proposals and updates to our processes, and the Operations team settled into a number of process improvements.</p><h3>Development</h3><p>All public repos can be found <a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation">here</a>.</p><h3>Zen testnet</h3><p>We launched the first public Sia testnet, nicknamed “Zen.” Historically, we have relied on local testnets (e.g. Sia-Antfarm) for this purpose, but a public testnet gives us and other Sia developers a proving ground that is easier to use and more closely resembles the production network. We will be reaching out and partnering with long-time hosts to increase the available storage on the testnet. Software downloads for the Zen Testnet version of siad are now available <a href="https://sia.tech/get-started">here</a>. A testnet explorer and siacoin faucet are live <a href="https://zen.sia.tech/">here</a>.</p><h3>mainnet</h3><p>We have begun uploading and plan to maintain various public datasets on Sia to demonstrate the network’s storage capabilities. Metadata for these uploads will be publicly available on our website, allowing anyone to download the datasets using renterd. In total, we expect to upload around 2PB to the network.</p><h3>core</h3><p>The core repo is currently public and can be found <a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/core">here</a>.</p><ul><li>Converted renterd to use the new go.sia.tech/core types. This improves performance and will ease the transition to Utreexo. &lt;<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/core/pull/77">Code</a>&gt;</li></ul><h3>mux</h3><ul><li>Added v1 support to go.sia.tech/mux, allowing renterd and hostd to use this package and seamlessly upgrade to the v2 mux protocol when the peer supports it. &lt;<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/mux/commit/c3ab68bec66af815271efe5303aa4314d4664578">Code</a>&gt;</li></ul><h3>jape</h3><p>jape is what we use to check that the API routes between client/server are consistent</p><ul><li>Fixed some bugs. &lt;<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/jape/pull/9">Code</a>&gt; and &lt;<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/jape/pull/8">code</a>&gt;</li><li>Wrote Github Actions task to run the jape checker on our repositories. &lt;<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/action-golang-analysis">Code</a>&gt;, &lt;<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/renterd/pull/96">code</a>&gt;, &lt;<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/explorer/pull/5">code</a>&gt;, and &lt;<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/walletd/pull/9">code</a>&gt;</li></ul><h3>renterd</h3><p>renterd will be our new stand-alone renter. The renterd repo is currently public and can be found <a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/renterd">here</a>, and the app is expected to be released in beta by the end of Q1.</p><ul><li>renterd had a lot of bug fixing to make uploads faster</li><li>Working on a PR for basic Open Telemetry support</li><li>Automated wallet maintenance in the autopilot which speeds up contract creation quite well</li><li>Basic support for fetching price tables and funding ephemeral accounts, which is the groundwork for making downloads use ephemeral accounts for paying hosts</li><li>Merged contract locking, so multiple workers can safely download and upload from the same set of contracts</li><li>Added logging</li><li>Added Dockerfile</li><li>Added renewals</li><li>Added migrations</li><li>Added host blocklist</li><li>Added gouging checks</li><li>Improved performance (contractor/bus)</li><li>Fixed many of the bugs we introduced</li></ul><h4>renterd UI</h4><ul><li>The wallet now shows pending transactions</li><li>Added an upload manager that shows status and progress of each upload</li><li>Now supports logging in to remote servers</li><li>Now features an advanced configuration menu for gouging and redundancy settings</li><li>All forms now show settings that have been changed in green, and a summary count of changes next to the save action</li><li>Added a command palette for finding and interacting with any feature. The command palette can be launched with the ⌘+K hotkey</li></ul><h3>hostd</h3><p>hostd is the app you’ll be using to rent out your excess storage space to the Sia network.</p><ul><li>Added consistency checks to the volume manager.

The Grants Program was created to fund research, development, developer tools, and anything else that will support and further our mission of user-owned data while enriching the Sia ecosystem.</p><p>Just design a proposal that meets our requirements, submit to our forums, and wait for review by our grants committee. If your grant gets approved, you’re on your way to creating the next great project on the Sia storage network.</p><p>Check out <a href="https://sia.tech/grants">our site</a> for more info.</p><h3>The Current State of Grants</h3><p>2023 has been off to a great start with new grant proposals and progress reports for existing grants. We’ve been fortunate to approve one of those new proposals already, and plan to review the others on our normal schedule.</p><p>Every grantee must provide monthly progress reports, and the committee was pleased with the updates presented so far. These reports are an essential step in maintaining the transparency associated with the program and the dispersement of funds.</p><h3>Alphaday</h3><p><a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/alphaday-is-a-powerful-crypto-workflow-aggregator-that-pulls-in-news-on-chain-data-social-media-web3-services-and-much-more-into-one-customizable-ui/">Link</a></p><h4>What is it?</h4><p><strong>Alphaday</strong> is a Sia news, on-chain data, and social media aggregator.</p><h4>Grant Status</h4><p>Approved</p><h4>Updates</h4><p>Alphaday was a brand new proposal that presented us with a first-time challenge — development will require the project to use closed-source libraries or other components, while other critical components (and the new project code itself) will be open-source and transparent. This led to a new consideration for us, that we summarized as such:</p><blockquote>“Projects can use closed-source components, but can’t develop closed-source code.”</blockquote><p>Obviously, approval of proposals is still at the discretion of the committee, but this should give projects a little bit of flexibility in the future.</p><h3>Lume Web Progress Update</h3><p><a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/grant-proposal-lume-web/229/31">Link</a></p><h4>Grant Status</h4><p>In development</p><h4>Updates</h4><p>Derrick provided an incredibly extensive update for Lume Web, with links aplenty.</p><blockquote>Progress so far has been switching to the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/protomux">Protomux 1</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/protomux-rpc">Protomux-RPC</a> libraries and building a new RPC protocol based off of it from the original RPC design. This has the benefit of enabling any plugin to define a custom protocol due to the new PluginAPI.protocols</blockquote><p>Derrick also provides a statement of focus: web3 Hypercore P2P network and related ecosystem software, browser extension and related ecosystem software, educational and community Sites, and a new web portal software stack.</p><h3>Sia Satellite Progress Update</h3><p><a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/grant-proposal-sia-satellite/240/9">Link</a></p><h4>Grant Status</h4><p>In development</p><h4>Updates</h4><p>Courtesy of Mike, Sia Satellite sees significant progress as well, selecting a payment provider as well as sorting out account logistics.</p><blockquote>I had to change my initial planning and focus on the user accounts and the payment processing first. The users can now create accounts, log in, change their passwords, and delete their accounts if they like. When they log in, they are redirected to the dashboard (still work in progress) where they can see their balance and some Sia network averages and create a payment plan based on their storage requirements.</blockquote><p>What’s next for Sia Satellite? Adding a Stripe webhook to update the user balance after payment, followed by moving from test mode to live mode, moving HostDB from JSON to MySQL and optimizing the payment calculation, creating a command-line client to improve the control of the daemon, and moving on to form contracts with the hosts.</p><h3>Coming Next</h3><p>The committee has two other new proposals to review, including our first research-centric proposal which should give us something fun to talk about. We’re still really excited to see proposals continue to stream in, and are emboldened by the variety of each one. The program seems to be making progress towards its goal of enriching the Sia ecosystem.</p><p>You can see the list of all proposals <a href="https://forum.sia.tech/c/foundation/grants/">here</a>, and our proposal requirements <a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/about-the-grants-category/">here</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*De25D4TTugOxOZEQghDn5g.png" /></figure><p>We’re back with the State of Sia, a monthly installment looking at development and team updates for The Sia Foundation.</p><p>Welcome to 2023! A new year always stirs excitement for the future and reflection at what was accomplished the year prior. For an individual, it might be time to make that resolution a reality. For an organization, it’s time to re-align on goals and get ready for another year of forward progress.</p><p>When I joined the Foundation, there were just a few months left in 2022. Even within my short time here, I’m incredibly proud to see how much we’ve grown. Here’s a highlight reel of a few notable things the Foundation did throughout last year:</p><ul><li>got listed on <a href="https://web3index.org/sia">Web3Index</a></li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*l6eUKfFTgljFoq-rxvHq3g.png" /></figure><ul><li>released <a href="https://blog.sia.tech/escrowless-siafund-swaps-da418ed50df0">Embarcadero</a>, a tool for conducting escrowless Siafund/Siacoin swaps</li><li>completely redesigned <a href="https://sia.tech">sia.tech</a></li><li>released Sia v1.5.8 and v1.5.9</li><li>launched the <a href="https://sia.tech/grants">Grants Program</a>, and approved four of the eight initial proposals</li><li>brought on <a href="https://sia.tech/about-sia-foundation">three new hires</a> from Skynet Labs (hi!)</li><li>and most importantly, made lots of progress on our new apps for Sia — renterd, hostd, and walletd</li></ul><p>We made pretty big strides in terms of our development focus and organizational structure, and we intend to carry this into the new year. Before I get ahead of myself though, let’s take a walk through specific work done in the month of December.</p><h3>Development</h3><p>All public repos can be found <a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation">here</a>.</p><h4>core</h4><p>The core repo is currently public and can be found <a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/core">here</a>.</p><p>We implemented a modernized version of Sia’s consensus code. This will make syncing much faster, enable blockchain pruning, and greatly ease the transition to Utreexo. This code has not been merged yet; first, we need to run the new version alongside the old version while processing the entire blockchain, to ensure there are no discrepancies between the two.</p><p>Relevant code is <a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/core/tree/v1">here</a>.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*voALc9s_CJbD7iLgRd7MOQ.png" /></figure><h4>renterd</h4><p>renterd will be our new stand-alone renter. The renterd repo is currently public and can be found <a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/renterd">here</a>.</p><p>We worked on getting uploads, downloads, automatic contract formations and renewals (all functions of the autopilot) working in production and beyond our integration tests to allow for more expansive testing.</p><ul><li>Implemented upload + download HTTP endpoints in renterd, with support for range requests.</li></ul><blockquote>Note from Luke: Range requests are a feature of HTTP APIs that allows you to download “ranges” of data within a file, rather than having to download the entire thing. It’s a pretty basic feature, but an important one.</blockquote><ul><li>Added price gouging checks, though not quite finished. Although that’s not 100% finished yet</li><li>Next step is migrations (data repair)</li></ul><h4>hostd</h4><p>hostd is the app you’ll be using to rent out your excess storage space to the Sia network.</p><ul><li>Migrated API to SiaFoundation/jape, add missing endpoints from spec</li><li>Replaced us in integration tests with renterd</li><li>Added payout transactions to SingleAddressWallet</li><li>Replaced remaining ephemeral stores with SQLite stores</li><li>Replaced consensus module with chain manager</li></ul><h4>walletd</h4><p>walletd will be the place to store your Siacoins.</p><p>We ultimately decided not to go with the bitcoin coin selection algorithm because, after writing some simulation code, we found it was not much better from a fee minimization perspective than the random algorithm.</p><h4>skyrecover</h4><p>skyrecover is a set of utilities to recover lost skyd data. The skyrecover repo is currently public and can be found <a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/skyrecover">here</a>.</p><ul><li>Created a tool to search hosts for lost sectors using the Skynet file metadata</li><li>Created a tool to download lost sectors from hosts using the Skynet file metadata</li></ul><h4>Web/website</h4><p>The Sia Network Hosting Best Practices document has been added to the <a href="https://sia.tech/hosting-best-practices">website</a>. The Sia Foundation has prepared this document to provide high level guidance for using the Sia network. Our goal in doing so is not to provide legal advice, but to establish a set of common best practices for Hosts. This will help ensure the continued efficient functioning of the Sia network and enable Hosts and Renters alike to continue to realize its benefits.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*qk0jwCEqBcC6ASsTuiMDpw.png" /></figure><p>The Sia Foundation suggests that all Hosts know and follow these best practices. Please also check back to review these best practices, as we may update them from time to time.</p><p>We have updated the grants page to be a little more specific, and will soon add more useful information such as an FAQ section.</p><h4>Web/renterd</h4><p>We continued work on the renterd app and integrating the new bus and autopilot APIs across all features.</p><p>We built a React library for interacting with renterd&#39;s new bus and autopilot APIs. The library is a set of fully typed React hooks for fetching data and making mutations. The library will release along with the renterd app, and will be a convenient option for any developers looking to build UIs with the renterd APIs.</p><h3>Team Updates</h3><p>Our three newest hires have all settled into their new roles nicely. Chris and PJ found their footing immediately and set to work on various renterd tasks. I know the team really appreciates having more highly experienced Sia devs to share ideas and workload as we develop these powerful new apps.</p><p>I hope the Ops team is as happy about me joining the team as I am to be here! We’ve set to work on a few important things, like enacting new policies for the team and taking over project management for the Grants Program. My aim is always to help an organization marry efficiency and compassion, and I‘m proud to be part of a team here at the Foundation that strives for these goals.</p><h3>Other Foundation Happenings</h3><h4>Advent of Code</h4><p>Advent of Code presented a month of fun challenges, and we’re thankful to all participants. As mentioned last month, any participant who completed seven or more days will receive a prize from the team. We’ll have an announcement regarding the prize this week or early next. If you qualify, keep an eye on the #announcements channel in our <a href="https://discord.gg/sia">Discord server</a> for more info.</p><h4>Quarterly Report</h4><p>The <a href="https://sia.tech/transparency/2022-q4.pdf">Q4 2022 Transparency Report</a> has been published! These updates are an important part of the transparency that we promote, giving our community insight into our highlighted work, financials, and future plans.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*mVW9BeL6bSdrYj4o8p9AaQ.png" /></figure><p>And remember, you can always check out our previous updates over on <a href="https://sia.tech/about-sia-foundation">our website</a>.</p><h4>Grants Program</h4><p>We’re really pleased with how the Grants Program performed in 2022. The committee reviewed a total of eight proposals and approved four, and we’re excited to see how these projects develop over the coming year.</p><p>Remember to check <a href="https://blog.sia.tech/">blog.sia.tech</a> to find out the latest grant happenings.</p><p>If you think you’ve got a great idea to benefit the Sia ecosystem, submit your proposal over at <a href="https://forum.sia.tech/">forum.sia.tech</a>.</p><h3>That’s all folks</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/710/0*unGzC6L5jDHrDUne.jpeg" /></figure><p>From everyone here at the Foundation, thank you for a wonderful 12 months, and thank you for your continued support. The new year sees us refreshed, with a larger team, and on the brink of releasing some of the most significant software the Sia network has ever seen.</p><p>Until next time!</p><p><a href="https://discord.gg/sia">Discord</a>, <a href="mailto:hello@sia.tech">Email</a></p><h3>Steve</h3><p>steve#4381 on Discord</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=2bc5aa0cc541" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://blog.sia.tech/the-state-of-sia-january-2023-2bc5aa0cc541">The State of Sia, January 2023</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.sia.tech">The Sia Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*TIlrbuX9_HpkhMAUpDuaOQ.png" /></figure><p>The Sia Foundation has grant funding available for community contributors! The Grants Program was created to fund research, development, developer tools, and anything else that will support and further our mission of user-owned data while enriching the Sia ecosystem.</p><p>Just design a proposal that meets our requirements, submit to our forums, and wait for review by our grants committee. If your grant gets approved, you’re on your way to creating the next great project on the Sia storage network.</p><p>Check out <a href="https://sia.tech/grants">our site</a> for more info.</p><h3>The Current State of Grants</h3><p>December saw a handful of new grant proposals and updates to existing ones. Unfortunately, due primarily to underdeveloped or unclear submissions, all new proposals have been rejected. The beauty of the program is that no rejection is forever, and a proposal can be updated after the initial rejection for future consideration.</p><h3>Fabstir</h3><p><a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/grant-proposal-fabstir/">Link</a></p><h4>What is it?</h4><p><strong>Fabstir is a Web3 platform</strong> for e-commerce, video and audio streaming, social media and governance for a fairer society.</p><h4>Grant Status</h4><p>Previously Approved</p><h4>Updates</h4><p>Fabstir was required to submit a clearer budget justification for their grant proposal, and this was accepted by the committee.</p><p>As we’ve seen multiple times already during the early stages of the Grants Program, more clarity has always been helpful to the decision-making of the Grants Committee. Anyone considering submitting a proposal should keep this in mind.</p><h3>Decentralized Feminine Health Data</h3><p><a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/decentralized-feminine-health-data/">Link</a></p><h4>What is it?</h4><p>An app designed to help women track their menstrual cycle and other health information without fear of government eavesdropping.</p><h4>Grant Status</h4><p>Rejected</p><h4>Updates</h4><p>I’ll editorialize for a moment here to say that I love the idea behind the project. I think it introduces a practical and user-focused application of Sia’s benefits.</p><p>However, DFHD was rejected by the committee for a number of reasons, including lack of risk identification, budget justification, definition of scope, and how Sia fit into the picture. A scarcity of communication in the original thread when questions were asked didn’t help make its case either, but as with all rejections the committee is happy to reconsider if the proposal is updated.</p><h3>Hype Squad</h3><p><a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/grant-proposal-hype-squad-dao-focused-on-education-in-web3/">Link</a></p><h4>What is it?</h4><p>A DAO focused on education in web3.</p><h4>Status</h4><p>Rejected</p><h4>Updates</h4><p>Education is always a virtuous pursuit, unfortunately this proposal lacks in many areas, including specifying how this proposal benefits Sia or the Foundation’s mission.</p><h3>CryptoChefs &amp; Cryptonaire</h3><p><a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/gamify-the-education-of-sia/">Link</a></p><h4>What is it?</h4><p>This project wants to gamify the education of Sia</p><h4>Status</h4><p>Rejected</p><h4>Updates</h4><p>This was rejected due to not identifying a meaningful impact on the Sia community, as well as apparently failing to meet the open source requirement.</p><h3>NearPay</h3><p><a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/grant-request-add-siacoin-to-nearpay-on-ramp-widget/">Link</a></p><h4>What is it?</h4><p>This grant would add Siacoin to the NearPay widget.</p><h4>Status</h4><p>Rejected</p><h4>Updates</h4><p>This grant proposal made it clear that code would not be open source, and seemed to be more fitting as an exchange discussion.</p><h3>Coming Next</h3><p>The committee might have a holiday lull here, as no new proposals are currently awaiting review. We’ve got some ideas in our back pocket to spur Grants Program growth as we head into next year.</p><p>You can see the list of all proposals <a href="https://forum.sia.tech/c/foundation/grants/">here</a>, and our proposal requirements <a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/about-the-grants-category/">here</a>. See you next month!</p><h3>Steve</h3><p>steve#4381 on Discord</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=f7be5f103d13" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://blog.sia.tech/grants-program-update-december-2022-f7be5f103d13">Grants Program Update, December 2022</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.sia.tech">The Sia Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

You’ll hear about both shortly!</p><p>The first of these updates released last month and was received quite well in the community. We were incredibly pleased to see that. We want to better communicate the progress we make, and it seems like this update is shaping up to be a great first step towards that goal.</p><p>We could also <a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1586127052767318016/photo/1">print out the code</a> and send it to you, but we’ll stick with this method for now.</p><h3>Development</h3><h4>renterd</h4><p>renterd will be our new stand-alone renter.</p><p>Significant progress continues on the new renterd. A meeting of the minds for the three developers involved resulted in an architectural overhaul of the app. renterd will now consist of three components: worker, bus, and autopilot (names could change). <a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/renterd/pull/16">Here&#39;s the PR</a>, and here’s the tl;dr:</p><p>bus is the source of the truth for the stuff, worker does the stuff, and autopilot makes all the stuff happen easily. “Stuff” in this case of course being the litany of contract formations, blockchain checking, downloads, and other work that any particular instance of Sia used for renting must do.</p><p>This architecture allows renterd to scale horizontally (important for third party use), and will let our devs work mostly independently as they each tackle a component.</p><p>renterd also saw continued work on its UI, primarily related to the new autopilot system, and designing it into the host and contracts features.</p><p>Some specific bits added to autopilot this month included:</p><ul><li>an initial autopilot loop</li><li>a contractor</li><li>a host scanner</li><li>host filtering and scoring</li><li>migrated the backend (object store, contract store and hostdb) over to a SQL database</li><li>currently working on object repairs in the autopilot</li><li>building a test suite for integration tests</li></ul><p>For worker, contributions were made to host metrics.</p><h4>hostd</h4><p>hostd is the app you’ll be using to rent out your excess storage space to the Sia network.</p><ul><li>Refactored the financial manager</li><li>Fixed accounting issues related to ephemeral accounts</li><li>Refactored the MDM executor</li><li>Added financial tracking to all income sources for RHP2 and RHP3</li><li>Migrated financial store and contract metadata store to SQLite from BadgerDB. Tested a wallet store with SQLite.</li><li>Added integration tests for financials</li><li>Additional consistency tests for siad renters</li></ul><h4>skyrecover</h4><p>skyrecover is a set of utilities to recover lost skyd data.</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/skyrecover/commit/1b4ee10d757df0efdac09349349699a2bb99f962">Fix issue recovering small files</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/skyrecover/commit/97ad97319f3c536999ac877f591e45bcd6fb4921">Added tool to scan base sectors for a specific checksum</a></li></ul><h4>walletd</h4><p>walletd will be the place to store your Siacoins.</p><p>We worked on making the jape API checker <a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/jape/pull/5">more robust</a>. These checks prevent a common developer error where more than one HTTP response is sent.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/walletd/pull/8">This PR</a> added the bitcoin coin selection and the single random draw selection algorithm to the walletd rewrite. We’re now working on simulating past transactions to see which algorithm is more efficient in terms of minimizing fees.</p><h4>web</h4><p>We refactored styling across the Sia design system and apps, migrating all code to Tailwind, a popular CSS framework. Tailwind’s widespread use amongst developers will make future contributions to Sia’s UI code easier. We also updated the website to be more optimized for mobile layouts (and other minor updates to content).</p><h3>Team Updates</h3><p>Chris joined the team in November! To say this is a great pick up for the Foundation is an understatement. Coming from Skynet Labs, Chris has been working on Sia for longer than anyone except for Sia’s co-founders Luke and David. He brings intimate knowledge of the codebase and wonderful new ideas to the team.</p><p>Here’s what Luke had to say about Chris joining the Sia Foundation.</p><blockquote>We have another exciting addition to announce: Chris has joined the Foundation! Chris really needs no introduction; he discovered Sia in the early days of the project, and has been making enormously valuable contributions ever since, spanning nearly the entire codebase. Needless to say, I’m very pleased to have him aboard to lend his experience and passion to renterd, Utreexo, and beyond. Welcome! :)</blockquote><blockquote><em>- Luke Champine, President and Core Developer of The Sia Foundation</em></blockquote><p>This is our last new hire for 2022. With three recent pick ups to add to an already excellent team, the Sia Foundation is well-positioned to rocket into 2023.</p><h3>Other Foundation Happenings</h3><h4>Advent of Code</h4><p>Advent of Code returns for 2022! AoC is a daily code challenge that can test your skills in fun and interesting ways. Join our private leaderboard using code 30280-c51e2e3e. Anyone who completes at least seven days will receive a prize (to be determined) from the Foundation!</p><h4>Quarterly update</h4><p>We’re working on our latest Quarterly Update, which you’ll see posted via our socials on January 1, 2023. Be sure to check out our previous updates over on <a href="https://sia.tech/about-sia-foundation">our website</a>.</p><p>These updates are an important part of the transparency that we promote here, giving our community insight into our highlighted work, financials, and future plans.</p><h4>Grants Program</h4><p>The Grants Program is finding its stride, allowing for community members to get funds for their Sia-related project. We recently published our first <a href="https://blog.sia.tech/grants-program-update-november-2022-83dd4a7e266e">Grants Program update</a>, detailing the first two grants that we’ve approved. This will be a new monthly post that you can check over at <a href="https://blog.sia.tech">blog.sia.tech</a> to find out the latest grant happenings.</p><p>We’re absolutely thrilled to be seeing new proposals dropping into the forum. If you think you’ve got a great idea to benefit the Sia ecosystem, submit your proposal over at <a href="https://forum.sia.tech">forum.sia.tech</a>.</p><h3>That’s all folks</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/710/0*PGPgZLGigMIJP6VN.jpeg" /></figure><p>Thanks for another great month! As we move toward the end of the year, we’re thankful for such a wonderful community. 2023 will see great things for the Sia Foundation, but we’re not through with 2022 yet. See you next time.</p><p><a href="https://discord.gg/sia">Discord</a>, <a href="mailto:hello@sia.tech">Email</a></p><h3>Steve</h3><p>steve#4381 on Discord</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=d2b9551d08dd" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://blog.sia.tech/the-state-of-sia-december-2022-d2b9551d08dd">The State of Sia, December 2022</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.sia.tech">The Sia Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>
