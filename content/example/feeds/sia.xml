The Grants Program was created to fund research, development, developer tools, and anything else that will support and further our mission of user-owned data while enriching the Sia ecosystem.</p><p>Just design a proposal that meets our requirements, submit to our forums, and wait for review by our grants committee. If your grant gets approved, you’re on your way to creating the next great project on the Sia storage network.</p><p>Check out <a href="https://sia.tech/grants">our site</a> for more info.</p><h3>The Current State of Grants</h3><p>2023 has been off to a great start with new grant proposals and progress reports for existing grants. We’ve been fortunate to approve one of those new proposals already, and plan to review the others on our normal schedule.</p><p>Every grantee must provide monthly progress reports, and the committee was pleased with the updates presented so far. These reports are an essential step in maintaining the transparency associated with the program and the dispersement of funds.</p><h3>Alphaday</h3><p><a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/alphaday-is-a-powerful-crypto-workflow-aggregator-that-pulls-in-news-on-chain-data-social-media-web3-services-and-much-more-into-one-customizable-ui/">Link</a></p><h4>What is it?</h4><p><strong>Alphaday</strong> is a Sia news, on-chain data, and social media aggregator.</p><h4>Grant Status</h4><p>Approved</p><h4>Updates</h4><p>Alphaday was a brand new proposal that presented us with a first-time challenge — development will require the project to use closed-source libraries or other components, while other critical components (and the new project code itself) will be open-source and transparent. This led to a new consideration for us, that we summarized as such:</p><blockquote>“Projects can use closed-source components, but can’t develop closed-source code.”</blockquote><p>Obviously, approval of proposals is still at the discretion of the committee, but this should give projects a little bit of flexibility in the future.</p><h3>Lume Web Progress Update</h3><p><a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/grant-proposal-lume-web/229/31">Link</a></p><h4>Grant Status</h4><p>In development</p><h4>Updates</h4><p>Derrick provided an incredibly extensive update for Lume Web, with links aplenty.</p><blockquote>Progress so far has been switching to the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/protomux">Protomux 1</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/protomux-rpc">Protomux-RPC</a> libraries and building a new RPC protocol based off of it from the original RPC design. This has the benefit of enabling any plugin to define a custom protocol due to the new PluginAPI.protocols</blockquote><p>Derrick also provides a statement of focus: web3 Hypercore P2P network and related ecosystem software, browser extension and related ecosystem software, educational and community Sites, and a new web portal software stack.</p><h3>Sia Satellite Progress Update</h3><p><a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/grant-proposal-sia-satellite/240/9">Link</a></p><h4>Grant Status</h4><p>In development</p><h4>Updates</h4><p>Courtesy of Mike, Sia Satellite sees significant progress as well, selecting a payment provider as well as sorting out account logistics.</p><blockquote>I had to change my initial planning and focus on the user accounts and the payment processing first. The users can now create accounts, log in, change their passwords, and delete their accounts if they like. When they log in, they are redirected to the dashboard (still work in progress) where they can see their balance and some Sia network averages and create a payment plan based on their storage requirements.</blockquote><p>What’s next for Sia Satellite? Adding a Stripe webhook to update the user balance after payment, followed by moving from test mode to live mode, moving HostDB from JSON to MySQL and optimizing the payment calculation, creating a command-line client to improve the control of the daemon, and moving on to form contracts with the hosts.</p><h3>Coming Next</h3><p>The committee has two other new proposals to review, including our first research-centric proposal which should give us something fun to talk about. We’re still really excited to see proposals continue to stream in, and are emboldened by the variety of each one. The program seems to be making progress towards its goal of enriching the Sia ecosystem.</p><p>You can see the list of all proposals <a href="https://forum.sia.tech/c/foundation/grants/">here</a>, and our proposal requirements <a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/about-the-grants-category/">here</a>. See you next month!</p><h3>Steve</h3><p>steve#4381 on Discord</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=5efcd9a5712d" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://blog.sia.tech/grants-program-update-january-2023-5efcd9a5712d">Grants Program Update, January 2023</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.sia.tech">The Sia Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*De25D4TTugOxOZEQghDn5g.png" /></figure><p>We’re back with the State of Sia, a monthly installment looking at development and team updates for The Sia Foundation.</p><p>Welcome to 2023! A new year always stirs excitement for the future and reflection at what was accomplished the year prior. For an individual, it might be time to make that resolution a reality. For an organization, it’s time to re-align on goals and get ready for another year of forward progress.</p><p>When I joined the Foundation, there were just a few months left in 2022. Even within my short time here, I’m incredibly proud to see how much we’ve grown. Here’s a highlight reel of a few notable things the Foundation did throughout last year:</p><ul><li>got listed on <a href="https://web3index.org/sia">Web3Index</a></li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*l6eUKfFTgljFoq-rxvHq3g.png" /></figure><ul><li>released <a href="https://blog.sia.tech/escrowless-siafund-swaps-da418ed50df0">Embarcadero</a>, a tool for conducting escrowless Siafund/Siacoin swaps</li><li>completely redesigned <a href="https://sia.tech">sia.tech</a></li><li>released Sia v1.5.8 and v1.5.9</li><li>launched the <a href="https://sia.tech/grants">Grants Program</a>, and approved four of the eight initial proposals</li><li>brought on <a href="https://sia.tech/about-sia-foundation">three new hires</a> from Skynet Labs (hi!)</li><li>and most importantly, made lots of progress on our new apps for Sia — renterd, hostd, and walletd</li></ul><p>We made pretty big strides in terms of our development focus and organizational structure, and we intend to carry this into the new year. Before I get ahead of myself though, let’s take a walk through specific work done in the month of December.</p><h3>Development</h3><p>All public repos can be found <a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation">here</a>.</p><h4>core</h4><p>The core repo is currently public and can be found <a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/core">here</a>.</p><p>We implemented a modernized version of Sia’s consensus code. This will make syncing much faster, enable blockchain pruning, and greatly ease the transition to Utreexo. This code has not been merged yet; first, we need to run the new version alongside the old version while processing the entire blockchain, to ensure there are no discrepancies between the two.</p><p>Relevant code is <a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/core/tree/v1">here</a>.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*voALc9s_CJbD7iLgRd7MOQ.png" /></figure><h4>renterd</h4><p>renterd will be our new stand-alone renter. The renterd repo is currently public and can be found <a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/renterd">here</a>.</p><p>We worked on getting uploads, downloads, automatic contract formations and renewals (all functions of the autopilot) working in production and beyond our integration tests to allow for more expansive testing.</p><ul><li>Implemented upload + download HTTP endpoints in renterd, with support for range requests.</li></ul><blockquote>Note from Luke: Range requests are a feature of HTTP APIs that allows you to download “ranges” of data within a file, rather than having to download the entire thing. It’s a pretty basic feature, but an important one.</blockquote><ul><li>Added price gouging checks, though not quite finished. Although that’s not 100% finished yet</li><li>Next step is migrations (data repair)</li></ul><h4>hostd</h4><p>hostd is the app you’ll be using to rent out your excess storage space to the Sia network.</p><ul><li>Migrated API to SiaFoundation/jape, add missing endpoints from spec</li><li>Replaced us in integration tests with renterd</li><li>Added payout transactions to SingleAddressWallet</li><li>Replaced remaining ephemeral stores with SQLite stores</li><li>Replaced consensus module with chain manager</li></ul><h4>walletd</h4><p>walletd will be the place to store your Siacoins.</p><p>We ultimately decided not to go with the bitcoin coin selection algorithm because, after writing some simulation code, we found it was not much better from a fee minimization perspective than the random algorithm.</p><h4>skyrecover</h4><p>skyrecover is a set of utilities to recover lost skyd data. The skyrecover repo is currently public and can be found <a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/skyrecover">here</a>.</p><ul><li>Created a tool to search hosts for lost sectors using the Skynet file metadata</li><li>Created a tool to download lost sectors from hosts using the Skynet file metadata</li></ul><h4>Web/website</h4><p>The Sia Network Hosting Best Practices document has been added to the <a href="https://sia.tech/hosting-best-practices">website</a>. The Sia Foundation has prepared this document to provide high level guidance for using the Sia network. Our goal in doing so is not to provide legal advice, but to establish a set of common best practices for Hosts. This will help ensure the continued efficient functioning of the Sia network and enable Hosts and Renters alike to continue to realize its benefits.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*qk0jwCEqBcC6ASsTuiMDpw.png" /></figure><p>The Sia Foundation suggests that all Hosts know and follow these best practices. Please also check back to review these best practices, as we may update them from time to time.</p><p>We have updated the grants page to be a little more specific, and will soon add more useful information such as an FAQ section.</p><h4>Web/renterd</h4><p>We continued work on the renterd app and integrating the new bus and autopilot APIs across all features.</p><p>We built a React library for interacting with renterd&#39;s new bus and autopilot APIs. The library is a set of fully typed React hooks for fetching data and making mutations. The library will release along with the renterd app, and will be a convenient option for any developers looking to build UIs with the renterd APIs.</p><h3>Team Updates</h3><p>Our three newest hires have all settled into their new roles nicely. Chris and PJ found their footing immediately and set to work on various renterd tasks. I know the team really appreciates having more highly experienced Sia devs to share ideas and workload as we develop these powerful new apps.</p><p>I hope the Ops team is as happy about me joining the team as I am to be here! We’ve set to work on a few important things, like enacting new policies for the team and taking over project management for the Grants Program. My aim is always to help an organization marry efficiency and compassion, and I‘m proud to be part of a team here at the Foundation that strives for these goals.</p><h3>Other Foundation Happenings</h3><h4>Advent of Code</h4><p>Advent of Code presented a month of fun challenges, and we’re thankful to all participants. As mentioned last month, any participant who completed seven or more days will receive a prize from the team. We’ll have an announcement regarding the prize this week or early next. If you qualify, keep an eye on the #announcements channel in our <a href="https://discord.gg/sia">Discord server</a> for more info.</p><h4>Quarterly Report</h4><p>The <a href="https://sia.tech/transparency/2022-q4.pdf">Q4 2022 Transparency Report</a> has been published! These updates are an important part of the transparency that we promote, giving our community insight into our highlighted work, financials, and future plans.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*mVW9BeL6bSdrYj4o8p9AaQ.png" /></figure><p>And remember, you can always check out our previous updates over on <a href="https://sia.tech/about-sia-foundation">our website</a>.</p><h4>Grants Program</h4><p>We’re really pleased with how the Grants Program performed in 2022. The committee reviewed a total of eight proposals and approved four, and we’re excited to see how these projects develop over the coming year.</p><p>Remember to chec<a href="https://blog.sia.tech/">blog.sia.tech</a> to find out the latest grant happenings.</p><p>If you think you’ve got a great idea to benefit the Sia ecosystem, submit your proposal over at <a href="https://forum.sia.tech/">forum.sia.tech</a>.</p><h3>That’s all folks</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/710/0*unGzC6L5jDHrDUne.jpeg" /></figure><p>From everyone here at the Foundation, thank you for a wonderful 12 months, and thank you for your continued support. The new year sees us refreshed, with a larger team, and on the brink of releasing some of the most significant software the Sia network has ever seen.</p><p>Until next time!</p><p><a href="https://discord.gg/sia">Discord</a>, <a href="mailto:hello@sia.tech">Email</a></p><h3>Steve</h3><p>steve#4381 on Discord</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=2bc5aa0cc541" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://blog.sia.tech/the-state-of-sia-january-2023-2bc5aa0cc541">The State of Sia, January 2023</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.sia.tech">The Sia Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*TIlrbuX9_HpkhMAUpDuaOQ.png" /></figure><p>The Sia Foundation has grant funding available for community contributors! The Grants Program was created to fund research, development, developer tools, and anything else that will support and further our mission of user-owned data while enriching the Sia ecosystem.</p><p>Just design a proposal that meets our requirements, submit to our forums, and wait for review by our grants committee. If your grant gets approved, you’re on your way to creating the next great project on the Sia storage network.</p><p>Check out <a href="https://sia.tech/grants">our site</a> for more info.</p><h3>The Current State of Grants</h3><p>December saw a handful of new grant proposals and updates to existing ones. Unfortunately, due primarily to underdeveloped or unclear submissions, all new proposals have been rejected. The beauty of the program is that no rejection is forever, and a proposal can be updated after the initial rejection for future consideration.</p><h3>Fabstir</h3><p><a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/grant-proposal-fabstir/">Link</a></p><h4>What is it?</h4><p><strong>Fabstir is a Web3 platform</strong> for e-commerce, video and audio streaming, social media and governance for a fairer society.</p><h4>Grant Status</h4><p>Previously Approved</p><h4>Updates</h4><p>Fabstir was required to submit a clearer budget justification for their grant proposal, and this was accepted by the committee.</p><p>As we’ve seen multiple times already during the early stages of the Grants Program, more clarity has always been helpful to the decision-making of the Grants Committee. Anyone considering submitting a proposal should keep this in mind.</p><h3>Decentralized Feminine Health Data</h3><p><a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/decentralized-feminine-health-data/">Link</a></p><h4>What is it?</h4><p>An app designed to help women track their menstrual cycle and other health information without fear of government eavesdropping.</p><h4>Grant Status</h4><p>Rejected</p><h4>Updates</h4><p>I’ll editorialize for a moment here to say that I love the idea behind the project. I think it introduces a practical and user-focused application of Sia’s benefits.</p><p>However, DFHD was rejected by the committee for a number of reasons, including lack of risk identification, budget justification, definition of scope, and how Sia fit into the picture. A scarcity of communication in the original thread when questions were asked didn’t help make its case either, but as with all rejections the committee is happy to reconsider if the proposal is updated.</p><h3>Hype Squad</h3><p><a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/grant-proposal-hype-squad-dao-focused-on-education-in-web3/">Link</a></p><h4>What is it?</h4><p>A DAO focused on education in web3.</p><h4>Status</h4><p>Rejected</p><h4>Updates</h4><p>Education is always a virtuous pursuit, unfortunately this proposal lacks in many areas, including specifying how this proposal benefits Sia or the Foundation’s mission.</p><h3>CryptoChefs &amp; Cryptonaire</h3><p><a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/gamify-the-education-of-sia/">Link</a></p><h4>What is it?</h4><p>This project wants to gamify the education of Sia</p><h4>Status</h4><p>Rejected</p><h4>Updates</h4><p>This was rejected due to not identifying a meaningful impact on the Sia community, as well as apparently failing to meet the open source requirement.</p><h3>NearPay</h3><p><a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/grant-request-add-siacoin-to-nearpay-on-ramp-widget/">Link</a></p><h4>What is it?</h4><p>This grant would add Siacoin to the NearPay widget.</p><h4>Status</h4><p>Rejected</p><h4>Updates</h4><p>This grant proposal made it clear that code would not be open source, and seemed to be more fitting as an exchange discussion.</p><h3>Coming Next</h3><p>The committee might have a holiday lull here, as no new proposals are currently awaiting review. We’ve got some ideas in our back pocket to spur Grants Program growth as we head into next year.</p><p>You can see the list of all proposals <a href="https://forum.sia.tech/c/foundation/grants/">here</a>, and our proposal requirements <a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/about-the-grants-category/">here</a>. See you next month!</p><h3>Steve</h3><p>steve#4381 on Discord</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=f7be5f103d13" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://blog.sia.tech/grants-program-update-december-2022-f7be5f103d13">Grants Program Update, December 2022</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.sia.tech">The Sia Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The penultimate month of 2022 was filled with progress as we worked on major initiatives and welcomed new team members. You’ll hear about both shortly!</p><p>The first of these updates released last month and was received quite well in the community. We were incredibly pleased to see that. We want to better communicate the progress we make, and it seems like this update is shaping up to be a great first step towards that goal.</p><p>We could also <a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1586127052767318016/photo/1">print out the code</a> and send it to you, but we’ll stick with this method for now.</p><h3>Development</h3><h4>renterd</h4><p>renterd will be our new stand-alone renter.</p><p>Significant progress continues on the new renterd. A meeting of the minds for the three developers involved resulted in an architectural overhaul of the app. renterd will now consist of three components: worker, bus, and autopilot (names could change). <a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/renterd/pull/16">Here&#39;s the PR</a>, and here’s the tl;dr:</p><p>bus is the source of the truth for the stuff, worker does the stuff, and autopilot makes all the stuff happen easily. “Stuff” in this case of course being the litany of contract formations, blockchain checking, downloads, and other work that any particular instance of Sia used for renting must do.</p><p>This architecture allows renterd to scale horizontally (important for third party use), and will let our devs work mostly independently as they each tackle a component.</p><p>renterd also saw continued work on its UI, primarily related to the new autopilot system, and designing it into the host and contracts features.</p><p>Some specific bits added to autopilot this month included:</p><ul><li>an initial autopilot loop</li><li>a contractor</li><li>a host scanner</li><li>host filtering and scoring</li><li>migrated the backend (object store, contract store and hostdb) over to a SQL database</li><li>currently working on object repairs in the autopilot</li><li>building a test suite for integration tests</li></ul><p>For worker, contributions were made to host metrics.</p><h4>hostd</h4><p>hostd is the app you’ll be using to rent out your excess storage space to the Sia network.</p><ul><li>Refactored the financial manager</li><li>Fixed accounting issues related to ephemeral accounts</li><li>Refactored the MDM executor</li><li>Added financial tracking to all income sources for RHP2 and RHP3</li><li>Migrated financial store and contract metadata store to SQLite from BadgerDB. Tested a wallet store with SQLite.</li><li>Added integration tests for financials</li><li>Additional consistency tests for siad renters</li></ul><h4>skyrecover</h4><p>skyrecover is a set of utilities to recover lost skyd data.</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/skyrecover/commit/1b4ee10d757df0efdac09349349699a2bb99f962">Fix issue recovering small files</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/skyrecover/commit/97ad97319f3c536999ac877f591e45bcd6fb4921">Added tool to scan base sectors for a specific checksum</a></li></ul><h4>walletd</h4><p>walletd will be the place to store your Siacoins.</p><p>We worked on making the jape API checker <a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/jape/pull/5">more robust</a>. These checks prevent a common developer error where more than one HTTP response is sent.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/walletd/pull/8">This PR</a> added the bitcoin coin selection and the single random draw selection algorithm to the walletd rewrite. We’re now working on simulating past transactions to see which algorithm is more efficient in terms of minimizing fees.</p><h4>web</h4><p>We refactored styling across the Sia design system and apps, migrating all code to Tailwind, a popular CSS framework. Tailwind’s widespread use amongst developers will make future contributions to Sia’s UI code easier. We also updated the website to be more optimized for mobile layouts (and other minor updates to content).</p><h3>Team Updates</h3><p>Chris joined the team in November! To say this is a great pick up for the Foundation is an understatement. Coming from Skynet Labs, Chris has been working on Sia for longer than anyone except for Sia’s co-founders Luke and David. He brings intimate knowledge of the codebase and wonderful new ideas to the team.</p><p>Here’s what Luke had to say about Chris joining the Sia Foundation.</p><blockquote>We have another exciting addition to announce: Chris has joined the Foundation! Chris really needs no introduction; he discovered Sia in the early days of the project, and has been making enormously valuable contributions ever since, spanning nearly the entire codebase. Needless to say, I’m very pleased to have him aboard to lend his experience and passion to renterd, Utreexo, and beyond. Welcome! :)</blockquote><blockquote><em>- Luke Champine, President and Core Developer of The Sia Foundation</em></blockquote><p>This is our last new hire for 2022. With three recent pick ups to add to an already excellent team, the Sia Foundation is well-positioned to rocket into 2023.</p><h3>Other Foundation Happenings</h3><h4>Advent of Code</h4><p>Advent of Code returns for 2022! AoC is a daily code challenge that can test your skills in fun and interesting ways. Join our private leaderboard using code 30280-c51e2e3e. Anyone who completes at least seven days will receive a prize (to be determined) from the Foundation!</p><h4>Quarterly update</h4><p>We’re working on our latest Quarterly Update, which you’ll see posted via our socials on January 1, 2023. Be sure to check out our previous updates over on <a href="https://sia.tech/about-sia-foundation">our website</a>.</p><p>These updates are an important part of the transparency that we promote here, giving our community insight into our highlighted work, financials, and future plans.</p><h4>Grants Program</h4><p>The Grants Program is finding its stride, allowing for community members to get funds for their Sia-related project. We recently published our first <a href="https://blog.sia.tech/grants-program-update-november-2022-83dd4a7e266e">Grants Program update</a>, detailing the first two grants that we’ve approved. This will be a new monthly post that you can check over at <a href="https://blog.sia.tech">blog.sia.tech</a> to find out the latest grant happenings.</p><p>We’re absolutely thrilled to be seeing new proposals dropping into the forum. If you think you’ve got a great idea to benefit the Sia ecosystem, submit your proposal over at <a href="https://forum.sia.tech">forum.sia.tech</a>.</p><h3>That’s all folks</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/710/0*PGPgZLGigMIJP6VN.jpeg" /></figure><p>Thanks for another great month! As we move toward the end of the year, we’re thankful for such a wonderful community. 2023 will see great things for the Sia Foundation, but we’re not through with 2022 yet.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Wbnkjlb8Ag_koc0fVHMYQA.png" /></figure><p>The Sia Foundation has grant funding available for community contributors! The Grants Program was created to fund research, development, developer tools, and anything else that will support and further our mission of user-owned data while enriching the Sia ecosystem.</p><p>Just design a proposal that meets our requirements, submit to our forums, and wait for review by our grants committee. If your grant gets approved, you’re on your way to creating the next great project on the Sia storage network.</p><p>Check out <a href="https://sia.tech/grants">our site</a> for more info.</p><h3>The Current State of Grants</h3><p>We launched the Grants Program two months ago, and in that time have reviewed three grant proposals. A couple more just dropped this week, but we’ll have more info on those later.</p><p>Two have been conditionally approved, and the third is awaiting some updates to the proposal. All three have potential to add great new features and tools to the Sia ecosystem, and we’re excited to see them develop as we move forward.</p><p>Let’s take a look at the two approved grants.</p><h4>Lume Web</h4><p>Status: <strong>Approved</strong></p><p>Lume Web is a project that aims to “unify the dWeb” and make strides towards a better web3. With plans for a Firefox browser extension for viewing web3 content, building upon his third party Skynet portal, and creating new educational sites for this new tech, Lume Web wants to be a major player in the still developing space. Longer term goals include a custom web browser and becoming the open hub for web3.</p><p>Derrick Hammer, Lume’s developer, plans to accomplish these goals throughout 2023. Here’s what Derrick had to say about Lume and his grant:</p><blockquote>I believe Lume is going to be the center hub of web3 and this is giving me a once in a lifetime opportunity to build an open ecosystem and have the community support me.</blockquote><blockquote>Simply put: Lume Web is web3 for the masses. Web1 was AOL, Web2 is Google, and Web3 will be Lume 🙃</blockquote><h4>Sia Satellite</h4><p>Status: <strong>Approved</strong></p><p>Sia Satellite wants to cut down barriers to entry. Currently, someone who wants to use Sia needs to get Siacoins in order to form contracts and pay the hosts who store their data. Sia Satellite will serve as an intermediary who handles all the complicated blockchain and contract stuff, leaving the user to pay for their storage easily with a credit card.</p><p>Developer Michael Bulanov submitted an ambitious proposal on a six month time line, and the grants committee recommended splitting up work into multiple parts/grants for more focused progress.</p><p>Mike is also a Sia Grants Committee member, and was therefore excluded from the discussion and approval process for Sia Satellite. He kept it simple when asked how he felt after his proposal was approved:</p><blockquote>Well, how do I feel… I feel, like, WOW!, I seem to have gone up to the next level of personal development.</blockquote><h3>Coming Next</h3><p>The committee has two new grants to sort through, and one to review updates for. We’re incredibly excited to have so many new opportunities to expand the Sia ecosystem with these wonderful community projects.</p><p>You can see the list of all proposals <a href="https://forum.sia.tech/c/foundation/grants/">here</a>, and our proposal requirements <a href="https://forum.sia.tech/t/about-the-grants-category/">here</a>. See you next month!</p><h4>p.s.</h4><p>Want to see more next update? Should we talk about all active proposals instead of just the current list of approved ones? Let us know!</p><h3>Steve</h3><p>steve#4381 on Discord</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=83dd4a7e266e" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://blog.sia.tech/grants-program-update-november-2022-83dd4a7e266e">Grants Program Update, November 2022</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.sia.tech">The Sia Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*P8rQ82pVc5_b690s_JhZNw.png" /></figure><p>Hello Sia community! Welcome to the first State of Sia, a new monthly installment looking at development and team updates for The Sia Foundation.</p><p>We decided that — considering the size of the team and dev manpower — these should be released once a month. That could easily change as we develop more sophisticated project management and bring on new talent, but you can expect that cadence for the first few iterations here.</p><p>Speaking of iterations, things might change month-to-month as we find our stride and gather community feedback on how best to present this info.</p><p>Finally, some of our repos are still private. For those that remember the many PR links of the Sia dev updates back in the pre-Skynet Labs days, know that we’ll re-instate those as we begin to make these repos public over the coming weeks and months.</p><p>That’s enough from me, so let’s get on with it!</p><h3>Development</h3><p>Let’s take a look at the progress of each major development initiative and what to expect moving forward.</p><h4>Our next-gen apps</h4><p>The current Sia-UI and siad let you interact with all of Sia in one app, but part of our updates to these will be splitting functionality into multiple separate programs. We know from years of experience that having everything together under a single roof results in a lot of dead weight for a vast majority of users. Even folks who do need it all usually use a separate instance for each use case. A quick example of this is that they might not want their long term siacoin storage intermingled with their renting funds, but there are lots of other scenarios that we hope to accommodate with this change.</p><p>Splitting everything up will result in three new apps: renterd for purchasing storage space to upload files, hostd for renting out your excess storage space to renters, and walletd if all you need to do is to hold siacoins somewhere safe.</p><h4>renterd</h4><p>renterd will be our new stand-alone renter. As with each next-gen app, there will be a UI client as well as the essential CLI version.</p><ul><li>Implemented parallel transfer algorithms for uploading, downloading, and migrating sector data (<a href="https://github.com/SiaFoundation/renterd/commit/817effb2d53d718a7c5f0f8369ff8f7ffcc0a300">Link</a>). This was an important function that allows renterd to behave like a good renter should and run lots of different tasks simultaneously.</li><li>Fixed deadlock + nil panic bugs, located courtesy of our most recent dev hire PJ!</li><li>Finished initial autopilot design and began work on host scanning/ranking. Autopilot is a critical feature that lets a renter get used by a non-developer. It automatically ranks hosts, forms contracts, and migrates (repairs) file data, and is by far the most complicated part of any renter.</li><li>Fixed a bug in renterd causing the object store to not be persisted</li><li>Worked on contract and host management UI features for renterd, leveraging much of last month’s work on similar features for hostd. Focused on consistency across renterd and hostd features, so all features feel familiar and follow the same user workflows</li></ul><h4>hostd</h4><p>hostd is the app you’ll be using to rent out your excess storage space to the Sia network.</p><ul><li>Finished reimplementing the MDM, accounts, registry, and RHP3 for hostd</li><li>Finished a test RHP3 renter for hostd</li><li>Built out the single address wallet module that is used in both the renterd and hostd UI applications. The wallet features an intuitive wizard and supports multiple currencies</li></ul><h4>walletd</h4><p>Finally, walletd will be the place to store your Siacoins.</p><ul><li>Added a JSON store and tests to preserve wallet data</li><li>Added an API test</li><li>Changed walletd’s API to use the jape framework instead of httprouter</li><li>Added hot and read-only wallet tests</li></ul><h4>web</h4><p>We made a series of updates to the website, including <a href="https://sia.tech/grants">the new grants page</a> where community members can learn how to get funding for their projects.</p><p>Website updates also include <a href="https://sia.tech/software/renterd">the new </a><a href="https://sia.tech/software/renterd">renterd landing page</a> which features screenshots of all the above mentioned work — so it’s another great place to stay up to date on the new renterd software! A similar page for hostd is coming soon.</p><h4>Stray dev bits</h4><ul><li>Built a utility to recover lost Skynet data using the file metadata</li></ul><h3>Team Updates</h3><p>PJ Brone joined the dev team in October, bringing his talents and extensive Sia ecosystem knowledge directly from Skynet Labs. Interestingly, PJ is one of the few devs on the former Skynet Labs team to have actually worked on Sia. Here’s what Luke had to say about PJ joining the team.</p><blockquote>PJ is a veteran of the Sia ecosystem and has a clear passion for writing high-quality code. He’ll be working with me directly on <em>renterd</em> and other core dev projects, which will be a big help. PJ is super friendly, hard-working, and deeply interested in making Sia a better platform for everyone. I&#39;m excited to see what we can build together. :)</blockquote><blockquote><em>- Luke Champine, President and Core Developer of The Sia Foundation</em></blockquote><p>Keep your eyes peeled this month. I think you’ll be happy to see another familiar face joining the Foundation.</p><h3>Other Foundation Happenings</h3><h4>Host memo update</h4><p>Work continues on our legal memo for hosts, and we still believe we are on track for a condensed, usable version of the findings to be published in Q4 of this year.</p><h4>Streamlining operations</h4><p>As we expand our talent pool and grow our operations team (by one 🙂), we’ve been refining our processes to better accommodate international contributors and non-profit standards.</p><h4>Grants Program</h4><p>The first ever grant has been approved by the Foundation’s Grants Program! Lume Web, which aims to unify the dWeb, will be built by community member pcfreak30 (Derrick) over the next year with grant funding.</p><p>We’ll have a separate blog post this month discussing the latest Grants Program updates, so stay tuned. Congrats to pcfreak30 and Lume!</p><h3>That’s all folks</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/710/1*UUUV6hsBIfO7qYzmUUJ96w.jpeg" /></figure><p>Thanks for reading this far!

Skynet will remain online.</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Qb2ylwebgLLlvo0iQoTyZw.png" /></figure><p>It is with regret that we announce Skynet Labs has been unable to complete its next round of fundraising and will be shutting down. Thankfully, Skynet as a platform will be able to continue operating: all user files will remain online and key portions of the infrastructure will continue to be actively developed. Unfortunately, Skynet will have to continue without Skynet Labs and without many of the amazing people who have put their heart and soul into building a brighter future for users and user data.</p><p>Much of what Skynet has accomplished, including its ability to continue operating in the face of Skynet Lab’s dissolution, and including its ability to provide value to the wider web3 ecosystem, is owed to the efforts and contributions of the Skynet Labs team members. It is with great sadness that we will be letting the members of our team go, even though we have every need for and appreciation of their efforts.</p><p><strong>Read the full announcement to the Skynet community including what to expect next on </strong><a href="https://siasky.net/FAD8MqXHfRSbFXdZpQhw4Q09_ZWP2a-miEchmm0VUSzDUA"><strong>Siasky.net</strong></a><strong> or </strong><a href="https://skynetfree.net/FAD8MqXHfRSbFXdZpQhw4Q09_ZWP2a-miEchmm0VUSzDUA"><strong>Skynetfree.net</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=5397184e214d" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://blog.sia.tech/skynet-labs-is-shutting-down-skynet-remains-online-5397184e214d">Skynet Labs is shutting down.

Our <a href="https://blog.sia.tech/the-worrying-depth-and-scope-of-censorship-on-the-internet-ffd4bc5a5486">recent chaos</a> has caused us to reconsider what technology decisions are acceptable, and what it takes to build a robust platform that meets user expectations for decentralization.</p><h3>Fluid Skynet Portals</h3><p>It has become clear to us that we cannot use portals as a stable piece of infrastructure. The original idea behind portals was to make them a trusted, centralized infrastructure, but allow users to easily switch between portals in the event that a portal went offline. Users would have to find trustworthy portals but would have no exposure to vendor lock-in.</p><p>This original model was (and still is) several steps ahead of most web3 providers. Major infrastructure providers like Infura and Open Sea are both closed source and difficult to operate. Skynet portals on the other hand are open source and readily swapped out from each other.</p><p>The challenges with the original model were nonetheless significant. Users on different portals had difficulties sharing files with each other because files uploaded to one portal had a completely different URL than files to another portal. Retrieving files from a different portal required making changes to the URL, which is not difficult but is inconvenient.</p><p>The UX annoyances surrounding Skynet portals become more pronounced when we started experiencing regular deplatformings. Siasky became unstable, and even users who were using a common portal had to frequently change out the URL.</p><p>To address this, we’ve kicked off a project called the Skynet Kernel, which is a webapp plugin that automatically switches the user to their favorite portal, including being able to automatically use failovers if the user’s preferred portal is offline or otherwise unavailable. Thanks to Kernel, users can expect a reliable and consistent experience regardless of which portals they use, which portals their friends use, and which portals are currently offline.</p><p>The Skynet Kernel also means that less user education is required to get people using Skynet because Skynet overall feels significantly more like the traditional web, despite being decentralized.</p><h3>Skynet Portal APIs</h3><p>Portals on Skynet were originally, like most other web3 infrastructure, fully trusted. Users were expected to find a reliable and trustworthy portal operator and then hope that the operator did not inject malicious code while they were using Skynet.</p><p>Though this is how pretty much all of web3 works, we lost faith in the model. Especially when users are using multiple infrastructure providers and failing over between them, users need to have confidence that they are protected against all forms of malice.</p><p>We have since updated the Skynet portal APIs so that all major functions have fully verifiable endpoints. <strong>To the best of my knowledge, Skynet is the only web3 platform today that has accomplished this.</strong> Whether you are uploading files to Skynet (files of any size!), downloading files from Skynet (again, files of any size!), or using dynamic content, the portals offer cryptographic assurance that the request is being completed correctly.</p><p>The one major caveat with this upgrade is that modern web browsers do not have the ability to verify these cryptographic proofs. To get fully proper assurance that the portal is not acting maliciously, users need to install the Skynet Kernel browser extension. Even without a browser extension, we are able to significantly reduce user exposure to malice, but a user is only fully safe if they install the extension.</p><p>While the API supports all types of interactions trustlessly, the Skynet Kernel currently only supports registry actions, and small file actions (both uploads and downloads). The browser extension also does not yet support trustless webapp loading. All of these features are being developed, and we will get Skynet to the point of being fully trustless before too long.</p><h3>Skynet Portal Setup</h3><p>One critical focus for the Skynet team has been the ability for third parties to easily set up their own portals. A few months back we even had a workshop for people to set up their own portals. The workshop was nearly successful, with just a few hiccups that made a start-to-finish setup difficult for participants.</p><p>The portal stack has since gotten a bit more complicated, mostly owing to processes that we’ve had to add as a response to the turbulence of being continuously de-platformed. The portal now has more robust processes related to file repair and more robust processes related to MongoDB. Some of the health checks are also more robust.</p><p>As a result, we still haven’t yet achieved the creation of a simple workshop that can get a portal operator from zero to fully established in under 4 hours, but it has become a top priority for us and we hope to have the workshop completed within a month.</p><p>Two key upgrades since our previous workshop include switching from LastPass to Hashicorp and enabling support for text file configurations. Both upgrades should make it significantly easier for individuals to set up their own portals, and the removal of LastPass means we no longer have closed-source products as part of our portal stack.</p><p>We will reach out to the community soon with details about our next workshop — stay tuned!</p><h3>Improved Renter Stability</h3><p>Between the chaos of continuous de-platforming, the influx of new hosts, and the price turbulence on the network, the upload, download, and repair systems of the renter were put under stress. At one point, we lost user files due to our servers being fully unplugged without us having time to react.</p><p>Several bugs and instabilities have been fixed related to these systems. Downloads are now more stable and consistently fast. Uploads are also more consistently fast. Files more consistently stay in good health, and the total amount of repair required to keep a set of files online has been reduced.</p><p>One key change that we’ve made is that file repair now happens across servers as well as within a server. Prior to this enhancement, if a server got randomly ripped offline (say by an over-eager IT admin who is antsy about some phishing reports), the files that had been on that server would live for about a month before falling off the network, with no easy way to recover.</p><p>We now have a cross-server repair system that allows one server to tell if another server is no longer able to repair files. In that case, it’ll assume the responsibility and get the files up to good health. So long as a portal cluster has at least one server with operating capacity, files will not be lost from the cluster even if many of the servers are being brutally ripped offline.</p><h3>SDK Evolution</h3><p>As a part of the transition to a more fully decentralized stack, we’re beginning to transition the developer ecosystem from using skynet-js to using the libkernel and libkmodule libraries, which are part of the Skynet Kernel toolkit. At this point, both libkernel and libkmodule are still in alpha and are not recommended for fully deployed production applications. We expect to transition to beta within a few weeks, and then to v1.0 a few weeks after that. If all goes well, libkernel and libkmodule should be the default recommended libraries starting in October.</p><p>If you are familiar with the Skynet ecosystem, you know that Skynet development is broken into two major categories: webapps and <a href="https://docs.skynetlabs.com/skynet-topics/mysky-and-dacs">Data Access Controllers</a>. Previously, both types of development were done using skynet-js, which was effective but especially didn’t give DACs all of the features that they needed to be maximally useful. Furthermore, the standard for DACs was to use iframes, which had significant enough performance limitations that they really couldn’t be used in a composable way.</p><p>The new ecosystem tooling addresses this by moving DACs from iframes to web workers, where they are 10–30x faster in the naive case, and as much as 1000x faster in the optimized case. These performance boosts make composability tractable for real-time user applications. Further, DACs now have their own special library — libkmodule, which provides tooling that removes almost all of the boilerplate involved with writing DACs and allows developers to focus on the fun parts.</p><p>We’ve also updated the naming a bit. You will often now hear DACs referred to as “Kernel modules”, because Kernel modules provide substantially more functionality than the original DACs.</p><h3>The Skynet Kernel</h3><p>When computing transitioned from most applications being on the desktop to most applications being in the web browser, the user gained an enormous amount of convenience in the form of all of their data and experiences being available from every device, and all of their data surviving adventures like getting a new laptop.</p><p>This convenience came at a steep price, which is that corporations now control all of the user’s data, and the user transitions into a feudal state where they have to do things like rent the tools they use for work, and rent the music they listen to and the movies they watch. And they have to live with the fact that key parts of their lives can be taken away from them at any time.</p><p>The Skynet Kernel is a new programming paradigm that gives users all of the convenience of apps in the web browser with all of the liberty and control of running an open source desktop like Linux. It effectively allows webapps to run entirely in the client, while simultaneously having access to APIs that act like a cloud.</p><p>The Kernel is a fully trustless application environment. Every piece of code that runs is verified in full by the user, and at the user’s discretion can be swapped out with different code. All interactions with Skynet are verified cryptographically, ensuring the user can’t be lied to by the cloud. And because all of the programs run on the client, this also means that apps can’t be upgraded without the user’s permission — features that were once free can’t suddenly start charging money, because the user has the full autonomy to downgrade.</p><p>The Kernel can be used across the entire web3 ecosystem. The programming paradigm is fully generalized, which means you can use it to create trustless relays from webapps to things like the Ethereum blockchain. You can even use the Skynet kernel to inject trustless relays into centralized applications like OpenSea, allowing users to see the full list of assets even if the application itself is engaging in censorship.</p><h3>The Skynet Token Framework</h3><p>The Kernel is even powerful enough to run entire blockchains from the web browser. One of the biggest struggles of decentralized blockchains to date was figuring out how to convince everyday users to run full nodes. This problem is so difficult that most projects have entirely given up on it, and instead encourage users to depend on relays and trusted infrastructure.</p><p>We believe this problem can be solved by placing the blockchain full node directly into the browser via the Skynet Kernel. Users don’t even have to be aware that the full node is there, working in the background to verify all of their transactions. And this is exactly how the Skynet token will work. Every user will be using the blockchain from a full node.</p><p>However, the full Skynet token framework is so much more than a blockchain in the browser. It’s a means for Skynet applications to monetize without disrupting user experience. Skynet token is a micropayments platform that allows applications to charge users hundredths of a cent per page view without needing ads or consent paywalls. In one sense it’s like ERC20 on steroids, and in another sense, it’s like Patreon on steroids.</p><p>In the full design, every single user gets their own token. And every single application gets its own token. And every single piece of content released on Skynet gets its own token. That’s because on the web, contributions are provided by everyone. On Skynet, Reddit Karma isn’t just fake imaginary points, it’s monetization that pays users back for contributing meaningfully to the Internet.</p><p>The Skynet token blockchain features a large number of novel technologies, including Skynet-based block distribution, utreexo-based state management, a low power consumption proof of work algorithm, and a token framework similar to ERC20 that has no MEV. Everything has been optimized to run in the browser, ensuring that users who access Skynet exclusively from their phones are still able to enjoy the full benefits of a trustless blockchain.</p><p>Development progress for Skynet token is already well underway. We’re just a few weeks from having a fully functional in-browser blockchain featuring empty blocks. This includes support for miners, mining pools, and support for a peer-to-peer network. Once the empty-block chain is alive, we’ll be working on a wallet with support for the SKT asset (Skynet Token). And after that, we’ll finally implement and release the full token ecosystem.</p><h3>Focused on Fundamentals</h3><p>Over the past year, we’ve been quietly and persistently upgrading Skynet. We are sharply focused on two key objectives:</p><ol><li>Uncompromising decentralization</li><li>A user experience that is comparable to web2</li></ol><p>Achieving both of those things at the same time has required a substantial amount of innovation, but we are fortunate enough to have a team that is more than capable of consistently churning out new updates that push the boundaries of our industry.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=4aaf2ddf6587" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://blog.sia.tech/skynet-roadmap-and-update-summer-2022-4aaf2ddf6587">Skynet Roadmap and Update: Summer 2022</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.sia.tech">The Sia Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>
