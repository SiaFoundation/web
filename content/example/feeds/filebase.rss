Examples of DeFi include decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges, digital asset marketplaces for assets like NFTs, and decentralized eCommerce websites. </p><p>DeFi removes third-party, centralized institutions from financial transactions to provide widespread access to banking and financial accounts without paying transaction fees or requiring extensive documentation to open an account. This way, DeFi is able to provide financial freedom to individuals located in third-world countries without access to traditional institutions. It also provides a censorship-resistant alternative to traditional banking solutions. While DeFi might sound insecure or unreliable, it's actually highly secure and incredibly reliable, thanks to blockchain networks. </p><h3 id="how-defi-works">How DeFi Works</h3><p>DeFi uses blockchain networks to validate and execute transactions. When a transaction is submitted to a DeFi platform, whether it be a decentralized exchange or a simple transfer between wallets, the transaction is submitted to the blockchain's network of nodes. Blockchains use a pool of validator nodes to achieve network consensus, a process which verifies that the submitted transaction is valid and legitimate. Once validated, the transaction is recorded into a block along with other transactions and a record of the block that came before it. This creates a chain of blocks that are linked together, since each block contains info about the block directly before it. </p><p>Blockchains are permanent, immutable ledgers. Once a block has been written to the chain, it cannot be removed or changed. If blockchains were mutable, they wouldn’t be able to be trusted for executing financial transactions without a center intermediary. Only due to their immutable nature have they been able to facilitate DeFi functionality.</p><h3 id="benefits-of-defi">Benefits of DeFi</h3><p>DeFi has gained widespread traction across the globe not only due to its immutable nature but for other important reasons such as:</p><ul><li><strong>Accessibility</strong>: Creating a crypto wallet to send and receive crypto payments is a form of DeFi, and can be done by anyone without needing to verify your identity, make a deposit, or pay a fee.</li><li><strong>Low fees</strong>: DeFi transactions have low transaction fees compared to traditional centralized finance, and investing in various DeFi technologies like liquidity pools.</li><li><strong>Transparency</strong>: The record of all transactions on a blockchain network is publicly accessible, providing a level of transparency that can be verified by anyone.</li><li><strong>Autonomy</strong>: DeFi platforms don’t rely on centralized middlemen to approve transactions, and aren’t subjected to risks that traditional financial intermediaries are, like bankruptcy or adversity.</li></ul><h3 id="who-uses-defi">Who Uses DeFi?</h3><p>The beauty of DeFi is that it can be used by anyone in the world. Creating a crypto wallet and connecting it to a DeFi app or platform can be achieved by anyone. Currently, the most common users of DeFi include:</p><ul><li>NFT collectors and creators.</li><li>Cryptocurrency investors.</li><li>Personnel who don’t have access to traditional banking solutions.</li></ul><h3 id="how-does-defi-use-ipfs">How Does DeFi Use IPFS?</h3><p>For DeFi to truly be decentralized, it needs to use decentralized storage. Storing data on a centralized provider, like AWS, doesn’t support the DeFi attributes of transparency and decentralization. Data stored on centralized storage providers can be used for advertising or other unsolicited purposes, and is susceptible to outages due to its several single points of failure.</p><p><a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a>, or InterPlanetary File System, is a decentralized communication protocol that is used to facilitate the functionality of the IPFS network. Through the IPFS protocol, nodes around the world are connected to a decentralized peer-to-peer network that is used for file storage. This form of file storage uses content addressing, which is a manner of file retrieval that uses a content identifier rather than the file’s location on a web server. </p><p>IPFS is a popular solution for DeFi applications to store or host data, since all data stored on IPFS can be accessed publicly through the file’s content identifier, and things like <a href="https://filebase.com/blog/build-using-ipfs-not-https/">link rot</a> aren’t a concern. This provides a reliable and persistent data storage solution that isn't susceptible to outages due to the network's decentralized nature. </p><p>While it’s clear that DeFi uses decentralized blockchain peer-to-peer networks for transaction execution, how can DeFi utilize IPFS today?</p><ul><li>Decentralized eCommerce platforms can store product listing information like images, metadata, and transaction history off-chain on IPFS to minimize the amount of data they store on blockchains like Ethereum or Polygon.</li><li>Digital asset collections like NFT collections often use IPFS to store NFT images and their associated metadata files.</li><li>Decentralized applications that serve a decentralized finance function like a decentralized exchange app can be stored and deployed on IPFS, then accessed in a web browser using the application’s content identifier and an IPFS gateway.</li><li>Decentralized exchanges can store a record of their transaction history on IPFS as a secondary backup of all actions on their platform that can be easily referenced or parsed through.</li><li>Decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) voting and governance can use IPFS to store organization change proposals, such as how to distribute and spend DAO treasury funds. All votes for the proposal can be persisted off-chain on IPFS instead of being stored on-chain.</li></ul><h3 id="building-defi-with-ipfs-on-filebase">Building DeFi with IPFS on Filebase</h3><p><a href="https://filebase.com/">Filebase</a> is a decentralized storage and geo-redundant IPFS pinning service. All files stored in an IPFS bucket on Filebase are <a href="https://filebase.com/blog/ipfs-why-does-pinning-matter-anyway/">pinned</a> to the network with 3x redundancy across diverse geographic locations in the United States, London, and Germany.

Some people might think about a cork board that they pin photographs and other paper items onto in a collage format, while others might think about putting a decorative pin into a hat or jacket. The intent, however, is the same - whatever you are pinning, you want it to persist in the location you pinned it to in order for it to serve a purpose.</p><h2 id="what-is-pinning">What is Pinning?</h2><p>Pinning, in regards to IPFS, is similar to the idea of pinning a photo onto a cork board. </p><p>The InterPlanetary File System, or IPFS, is a decentralized peer-to-peer protocol that enables nodes to store and transfer files between one another. IPFS isn’t inherently a network itself - it's a communication protocol that outlines the workflow and components that enable the IPFS network to exist. Software like the IPFS daemon and IPFS desktop provide nodes the ability to participate in and interact with other nodes running the same software, thus creating a network of peers storing and sharing files between themselves. </p><p>When a file is stored on an IPFS node, it is stored in the node’s cache storage unless it is ‘pinned’. When a file is pinned on an IPFS node, it is stored in the node’s permanent storage, for long-term, persistent availability. Think of it like pinning a photo onto a cork board. The photo will remain on the cork board until you remove the pin. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://filebase.com/blog/content/images/2022/09/image-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="IPFS: Why Does Pinning Matter, Anyways?" srcset="https://filebase.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2022/09/image-1.png 600w, https://filebase.com/blog/content/images/2022/09/image-1.png 750w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="why-files-need-to-be-pinned">Why Files Need To Be Pinned</h2><p>If a file on an IPFS node isn’t pinned and remains in the node’s cache storage, the file will be removed during the next run of the automatic IPFS garbage collection process. Garbage collection is an automated process that frees up used resources on IPFS nodes to make space for new files to be stored in the node’s cache storage.</p><p>IPFS pinning is important if the file you upload needs to be accessible for a long period of time. It’s difficult to determine how long a file will be persistent on the IPFS network when it’s not pinned since while it can exist in one node’s cache storage, it can also exist in the cache storage of other nodes if those nodes have recently retrieved the file from the original node that was storing it. The garbage collection process might run at different times across these nodes, so while the original node might not store the file anymore, it might still be cached on another node or several other nodes. </p><p>Pinning ensures that no matter how many nodes have the file cached, it will always be available on at least one node. Most pinning providers only pin files on one IPFS node, which creates a single point of failure. If this single node goes offline, so do the files that it is pinning. While the files might be cached on other nodes, there is no guarantee that they are. </p><p>When a file is uploaded to a Filebase IPFS bucket, it is automatically pinned onto the IPFS network with copies stored on 3 different nodes across 3 diverse geographic locations in the United States, London, and Germany. This creates automatic 3x redundancy for all files pinned to IPFS through Filebase. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://filebase.com/blog/content/images/2022/09/IPFS3-Map.png" class="kg-image" alt="IPFS: Why Does Pinning Matter, Anyways?" srcset="https://filebase.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2022/09/IPFS3-Map.png 600w, https://filebase.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2022/09/IPFS3-Map.png 1000w, https://filebase.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2022/09/IPFS3-Map.png 1600w, https://filebase.com/blog/content/images/2022/09/IPFS3-Map.png 2050w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>By using Filebase for IPFS pinning, files aren’t at risk of being inaccessible due to a single point of failure. 2 of the 3 IPFS nodes pinning your file on the Filebase infrastructure could be offline, and your file would still be persisted on the network. This ensures that files maintain the highest level of reliability possible in comparison to other IPFS pinning services that only pin files once on a single node.</p><h2 id="pinning-content-to-ipfs-through-filebase">Pinning Content to IPFS Through Filebase</h2><p>To pin content to IPFS using Filebase, first, <a href="https://filebase.com/signup">sign up for a free Filebase account</a>. Then, log in to the <a href="https://console.filebase.com">web console dashboard</a>. </p><p>Create an IPFS Filebase bucket.

This means you migrate from pinning files on your own local IPFS node, or from another pinning service provider, and pin those files to Filebase without having to re-upload the files. Simply select ‘Upload’ then ‘CID’, instead of file or folder.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/j7b-qQRQWS3-kMFbmJEh6F3RDmb63AkyoYAgDJm9SVbNxW-kk3DEg948bRDYH-kZQ3vd41G27cBUUOw7R2h-tNesBm8IM1DQZlsfwMkyNDLLWkp3xhhoVKgG5JJgJpdFiEc7MEzKR8E82oKPausAaSPizBW9ookYWx-Ani60G1TtlcJQ74JlQ9iivA" class="kg-image" alt="IPFS: Why Does Pinning Matter, Anyways?"></figure><h2 id="ipfs-pin-sync">IPFS Pin Sync</h2><p>If you have hundreds or even thousands of IPFS CIDs that you want to migrate to Filebase and re-pin, it can be tedious and time-consuming to re-pin them one by one.

When a webpage is stored on a web server, it uses the HTTP/HTTPS protocol to serve that file as a public website that can be accessed around the globe. </p><p>When you navigate to a website, such as</p><blockquote>https://filebase.com/blog/heres-why-you-should-build-on-ipfs/</blockquote><p>you are navigating to a location where the article <a href="https://filebase.com/blog/heres-why-you-should-build-on-ipfs/">‘Here’s Why You Should Build On IPFS’</a> is located. This is because location addressing uses the location of the file within its hosting server. </p><p>For example, the blog post ‘Here’s Why You Should Build On IPFS’, is located on a web server that hosts the Filebase blog. If the blog post’s name portion of the URL, called a ‘slug’, changes or is moved, the link will no longer work and you will get an error page, like a 404 Not Found message. So if the title changes to ‘Here’s Why You Should Build On IPFS Today’, the link</p><blockquote> https://filebase.com/blog/heres-why-you-should-build-on-ipfs/ </blockquote><p>will no longer work.</p><h2 id="link-rot">Link Rot</h2><p>This disadvantage is referred to as ‘link rot’. It is one of the main disadvantages of using HTTP/HTTPS. Small changes to webpages or URL structures can cause entire webpages to be renamed and accessed at a new URL, causing updates to be required in any configurations that use those static URLs so that they reflect the new location of the content. </p><p>Several studies have been done to calculate how many URLs on the Internet are considered ‘dead’, or no longer accessible and return an error such as a 404 Not Found message. </p><p><a href="https://harvardlawreview.org/2014/03/perma-scoping-and-addressing-the-problem-of-link-and-reference-rot-in-legal-citations/">One study from 2014</a> of legal journals and other citations, found that about 70% of URLs originally cited in legal journals no longer existed, and around half of all URLs used by the United States Supreme Court for citing decisions no longer existed either. </p><p>Another study from 2012 estimated that of all social media links, about 30% would no longer exist in the next two years. </p><p>In a massive study completed by <a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/link-rot-study/">Ahrefs.com that compiled data over a nine-year period</a>, they found that out of 174.3 million links, around 26.9 million were considered ‘dead’ or ‘lost’. Of these, the most common errors associated with links being inaccessible were caused by the links being dropped (47.7%), meaning in most cases the domain no longer exists entirely, or they were removed (34.2%), which means that the pages still exist, but the slug has changed so the original URL no longer works.</p><h2 id="content-addressing-through-ipfs">Content Addressing Through IPFS</h2><p><a href="https://docs.filebase.com/storage-networks/ipfs">InterPlanetary File System</a>, or IPFS, uses content addressing to reference stored content instead of location addressing. Content addressing means that all content stored using content addressing is referenced through the content’s identifier, or CID. </p><p>When a file is uploaded to IPFS, the file’s contents are used to generate a cryptographic hash value. This value is used to generate a second value, known as the file’s content identifier.</p><p>Two things are always true about IPFS CIDs:</p><ul><li>The same file or folder added to two separate IPFS nodes using the same settings and parameters will produce the same CID. Any difference in the content, such as metadata differences, will produce a different CID.</li><li>The length of the CID will be the same for every file or folder, regardless of the file size or content.</li></ul><p>CIDs can be used to reference that file using IPFS native links or IPFS HTTP gateways.</p><p>IPFS native links are in the form of:</p><blockquote>ipfs://[CID]</blockquote><p>IPFS HTTP gateways bridge the gap between the IPFS network and programs that don’t natively support IPFS. By using an IPFS HTTP gateway, CIDs can be accessed by anyone in the world through a web browser. IPFS HTTP gateways are in the form of:</p><blockquote>https://ipfs.filebase.io/ipfs/[CID]</blockquote><h2 id="content-addressing-isn-t-susceptible-to-link-rot">Content Addressing Isn’t Susceptible to Link Rot</h2><p>Content addressing doesn’t rely on URLs to remain the same or for domains to stay active. IPFS CIDs can be accessed through any IPFS HTTP gateway, with over a hundred public gateways to choose from currently.  As long as a CID is available on the IPFS network, the content can be accessed.</p><h2 id="ipfs-pinning">IPFS Pinning</h2><p>To assure that CIDs are always available on the network, they must be pinned to an IPFS node. IPFS pinning is the process of storing a file or folder on an IPFS node’s permanent storage, rather than the node’s cache storage. If a file isn’t pinned, it’s stored in cache storage that will be cleared periodically by the network’s garbage collection process. </p><p>Filebase is a geo-redundant IPFS pinning service, meaning each file uploaded to IPFS through Filebase is pinned with 3x replication across different diverse geographic locations. This 3x replication provides important redundancy and reliability that ensures CIDs are always accessible and available.</p><p>You can<a href="https://filebase.com/signup"> sign up for a free Filebase account</a> to get started with your IPFS journey today.</p><p>If you have any questions, please join our<a href="https://discord.gg/rwXPs83Xsx"> Discord server</a>, or send us an email at hello@filebase.com.<br><br><br><br><br></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Upcoming changes to the Filebase platform]]></title><description><![CDATA[We're making big changes to the Filebase platform.

GitHub is popular for maintaining code repositories, but for deploying a project to be live on the web, it's often not the best choice. <br><br>What if there was a better way to store both your project’s files and any assets that it uses that benefits from decentralization without a single point of failure, plus flexibility for any workflow? </p><h2 id="what-is-ipfs">What is IPFS?</h2><p>IPFS, or Interplanetary File System, is a decentralized content addressing protocol. When a file is uploaded to the IPFS network, it is given a unique identifier called a <a href="https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/content-addressing/">content identifier</a>, or CID. The CID is a record of the file’s existence on the network. When your file is requested to be viewed or downloaded, the nodes on the IPFS network communicate with one another to determine which node is storing the content referenced by the requested CID. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://filebase.com/blog/content/images/2022/09/image--6-.png" class="kg-image" alt="Here's Why You Should Build On IPFS"></figure><p>When another node views or downloads the requested file, it is stored in the node’s cache data, creating another copy of the file within the network. The file will stay in the cache of the node until it is cleared through a process known as the IPFS garbage collection. </p><p>To keep files on the network indefinitely, they must pinned. Pinning is when a node on the IPFS network stores content without it being at risk of being deleted through the garbage collection process. </p><p>Since IPFS files and folders can be accessed through their CID, they can be referenced from anywhere in the world by anyone using an <a href="https://docs.filebase.com/storage-networks/ipfs/ipfs-gateways">IPFS gateway</a>. An IPFS gateway is dedicated to retrieving and serving content through a URL. This URL could be an IPFS URL like <em>ipfs:// </em>for programs or platforms that natively support IPFS, or this can be an HTTP URL like <em>ipfs.filebase.io/ipfs</em>. </p><p>By using content addressing, files on IPFS are:</p><ul><li>Available for anyone to view or download without authentication.</li><li>Available to be used by programs and platforms without restrictions.</li><li>Stored using a distributed network that is resilient to outages or disruptions. </li></ul><p>In addition to content addressing, all files uploaded to IPFS are <a href="https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/immutability/">immutable</a>. Once data is uploaded on IPFS, the file is immutable. If any changes are made to the file when it is re-uploaded, the CID generated for the file is different from the original. This is because when a file is uploaded, the CID is generated based on the cryptographic hash of the file. Any change to the file or its metadata will alter this cryptographic hash. </p><h2 id="filebase-geo-redundant-ipfs">Filebase: Geo-Redundant IPFS</h2><p>For a file to be truly decentralized and benefit from the persistence of the IPFS network, the IPFS pinning service must be announcing your data to the <a href="https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/dht/">DHT</a>, or distributed hash table. The DHT is responsible for mapping CIDs and their associated files across the network. If the IPFS pinning provider doesn’t announce to the DHT and the pinning provider’s node goes offline, so does your data.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://filebase.com/blog/content/images/2022/09/image--8-.png" class="kg-image" alt="Here's Why You Should Build On IPFS" srcset="https://filebase.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2022/09/image--8-.png 600w, https://filebase.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2022/09/image--8-.png 1000w, https://filebase.com/blog/content/images/2022/09/image--8-.png 1145w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p><a href="https://filebase.com">Filebase</a> is a geo-redundant IPFS pinning service that announces all data to the DHT. Every file and folder uploaded to the IPFS network through Filebase is automatically pinned to Filebase's IPFS infrastructure. Each pin is stored with a 3x level of redundancy, and each level is located in a different country and datacenter. The combination of DHT announcements and 3x redundancy provides a geo-redundant, reliable, and performant method of storing data on IPFS.</p><h2 id="what-can-i-build-on-ipfs">What can I build on IPFS?</h2><p>IPFS supports all file types, enabling hundreds of thousands of workflows. If you can think of it, you can build it. The most popular use-cases of IPFS currently include:</p><p><strong><a href="https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/how-to-develop-an-nft-smart-contract-erc721-with-alchemy">NFT Collections</a></strong>: NFT collections benefit from using IPFS CIDs to reference each NFT’s visual image file and its associated metadata file. </p><p><strong><a href="https://docs.unstoppabledomains.com/d-websites/connect-ipfs/">Decentralized Websites</a></strong>: IPFS supports hosting static websites through IPFS folders that contain the website’s assets and HTML files. These IPFS CIDs can be referenced throughout the world through IPFS gateways. Then, an IPFS gateway can be routed through a domain name like Unstoppable Domains. </p><p><strong><a href="https://medium.com/textileio/build-a-decentralized-chat-app-with-knockout-and-ipfs-fccf11e8ce7b">Decentralized Applications</a></strong>: dApps benefit from storing assets on IPFS, which can be referenced through their CID without having to reference or manage the files stored in the local development workspace. </p><p>Need some inspiration for your project?

Tableland can be used to store anything from tokenURI metadata to NFT extensions or DAO tools. Tables created and stored with Tableland utilize a user’s Ethereum wallet address for authentication, so no usernames, passwords, or access keys required.</p><p>Tableland can be used to record and track metadata for objects stored in a Filebase IPFS bucket. Objects stored on the IPFS network have an associated IPFS CID which is unique to each file, but isn’t easily identifiable like typical file IDs or storage paths are. To solve this, you can create a database with Tableland that tracks your objects and their associated file name, type, and IPFS CID so you can query it whenever you need to quickly reference an object.</p><p>Read below to learn how to use Tableland SQL to track object name, type, and IPFS CID of objects stored in an IPFS Filebase bucket.</p><h2 id="prerequisites-">Prerequisites:</h2><ul><li>Sign up for Tableland early access using their <a href="https://docs.tableland.xyz/building/quick-start">Quick Start</a> instructions.

Minting NFTs across various blockchains is now commonplace in the crypto world. However the storage of these NFT assets is <a href="https://messari.io/article/the-storage-layer-the-importance-of-metadata">often overlooked</a>. IPFS, known as the <a href="https://ipfs.io/">InterPlanetary File System</a>, has become the common standard used to store NFT assets.</p><p>One often overlooked detail is that IPFS is not a storage network in and of itself. It is much more of a data routing and transmission protocol. The IPFS network is a collection of nodes exchanging information. File entries can be "pinned" to the public IPFS DHT (distributed hash table) to let other nodes on the network know which hosts are storing which files. The tweet below covers it pretty well.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here&#39;s a secret: <a href="https://twitter.com/IPFS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@IPFS</a> is NOT a data storage protocol. It&#39;s a data routing protocol. <br><br>Start thinking that way and it will take you to a whole new universe.</p>&mdash; skøgard (@skogard) <a href="https://twitter.com/skogard/status/1496592549062008833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 23, 2022</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</figure><p>Within the IPFS ecosystem, there are a number of public gateways. Some of these gateways allow you to upload files, but there is often no guarantee that your file will remain online. Unless a file is explicitly pinned by an IPFS node, the file will simply be removed the next time the garbage collection process runs. This has surfaced a number of issues regarding the storage of NFTs.</p><p>To help solve this problem, a few different pinning providers have emerged. For a fee, these providers will allow you to upload your files, and they will keep them actively pinned for you. However this brings a new problem to light: where are these files actually being stored? Somewhere out there, an IPFS server is running and serving content, but where does the content ultimately live?</p><h2 id="filling-in-the-gaps">Filling in the gaps</h2><p>At Filebase, we've spent a lot of time researching and analyzing this problem. We specialize in building on top of decentralized storage, and our flagship S3 compatible API has processed close to 1 billion files. Just a couple of months ago, we put our thinking hats on and started working on this problem. Here is what we found:</p><ul><li>Most IPFS pinning providers use Amazon S3 and other centralized object storage services under the hood. The "data store" of an IPFS server can be pointed to S3 using a simple plugin.</li><li>Because AWS S3 is being used, providers are charging upwards of ~$150 per TB!</li><li>However, if AWS S3 goes down, <a href="https://filebase.com/blog/what-happens-when-my-cloud-goes-down/">your IPFS server goes down too</a>. Unless the data has been cached somewhere, your IPFS CID links are no longer accessible. This can result in an NFT "rug pull".</li><li>A system with this configuration also has the net result of introducing a very fancy way to access AWS S3. If we are so reliant on AWS, why not use a simple HTTP URL instead?</li></ul><h2 id="why-not-build-web3-with-web3">Why not build Web3 with Web3?</h2><p>We've come up with a solution to address the gaps listed above and we think it will benefit the entire crypto ecosystem. Simply put: Why not build Web3 with Web3?</p><p><strong>Today, we are excited to share that Filebase now has support for IPFS!</strong></p><p>Now you might ask - what makes this integration unique? It's simple: <strong>all files that are pinned onto IPFS using Filebase are actually being stored on <a href="https://sia.tech/">Sia</a>, one of the leading decentralized storage networks.</strong> This creates an environment where the data storage layer for our IPFS nodes is highly available, and most importantly, geo-redundant. By using a decentralized network for storage, we are no longer reliant on a cloud provider's block storage volume (AWS EBS) or a centralized storage bucket. (AWS S3)</p><p>A Filebase edge location could suffer a complete outage, and other locations will simply pick up the slack. This is made possible because the underlying data storage layer is decentralized.</p><p>Oh, and there's a massive cost benefit too:<strong> This is available to all Filebase users starting today, for $5.99 per TB while in beta.</strong> In the future, we may raise this pricing slightly based on usage patterns, but it will be nowhere near $150 per TB.</p><h2 id="how-do-i-pin-data-onto-ipfs">How do I pin data onto IPFS?</h2><p>With Filebase, pinning data onto IPFS is easy. You have two options:</p><ul><li>Use our simple drag and drop interface within the Filebase dashboard</li><li>Use our simple S3 compatible API</li></ul><p>When you upload a file, an IPFS CID (content identifier) will be returned. You can then use this CID to access your data from your own IPFS node, or any other IPFS gateway on the public internet. CID's are clearly displayed within our dashboard, and they can be retrieved programmatically as well.</p><p>Once you've opened up an IPFS bucket from the dashboard, a CID column appears. You can click on any CID, and it will be automatically copied to your clipboard.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://filebase.com/blog/content/images/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-01-at-11.23.05-AM.png" class="kg-image" alt="Introducing support for IPFS, backed by decentralized storage" srcset="https://filebase.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-01-at-11.23.05-AM.png 600w, https://filebase.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-01-at-11.23.05-AM.png 1000w, https://filebase.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-01-at-11.23.05-AM.png 1600w, https://filebase.com/blog/content/images/size/w2400/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-01-at-11.23.05-AM.png 2400w"><figcaption>The Filebase Dashboard</figcaption></figure><p>The object overview page will also show you the CID, along with other details:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full"><img src="https://filebase.com/blog/content/images/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-01-at-11.37.51-AM.png" class="kg-image" alt="Introducing support for IPFS, backed by decentralized storage" srcset="https://filebase.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-01-at-11.37.51-AM.png 600w, https://filebase.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-01-at-11.37.51-AM.png 1000w, https://filebase.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-01-at-11.37.51-AM.png 1600w, https://filebase.com/blog/content/images/size/w2400/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-01-at-11.37.51-AM.png 2400w"></figure><p>If you're using the S3 compatible API, the CID will be returned in the response of a <strong>PutObject</strong> call.

They both have features that make it easy to build scalable, zero-downtime applications—and they are both free. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to quickly back up your Kubernetes cluster files onto decentralized storage networks with Filebase.</p><h2 id="what-is-kubernetes"><strong>What is Kubernetes?</strong></h2><p>Kubernetes is an open-source container system designed for automating computer application deployment, scaling, and management.</p><p>Kubernetes clusters consist of multiple nodes, each running its own container (a cluster) with a minimal set of services such as networking, storage and compute. Common uses are for building applications or containers based on open source software, or for automating a local deployment environment. A cluster is the basic unit of functionality within a container environment.</p><p>Object storage is a great place for a Kubernetes cluster, and for file-system access in general. Filebase and Kubernetes provide a common API for retrieving files and directories from containers. This allows you to work with files on the surface infrastructure, but also keep your application layer isolated from the underlying volume types in a secure way.</p><h3 id="what-is-longhorn-io">What is <a href="http://Longhorn.io">Longhorn.io</a>?</h3><p><a href="http://Longhorn.io">Longhorn.io</a> is a distributed block storage system for Kubernetes that is lightweight, reliable and simple to use.</p><p><a href="http://Longhorn.io">Longhorn.io</a> can be configured to backup to a Filebase bucket.

Maybe you even got one as <a href="https://en.cryptonomist.ch/2021/12/18/nfts-become-christmas-gifts/">a Christmas gift this year</a>! Regardless how you’ve heard about them, you’re probably still wondering exactly what they are and why there's <strong>so much buzz</strong> around them right now. </p><h2 id="what-is-an-nft">What is an NFT?</h2><p>NFTs, also known as “non-fungible tokens”, are a type of crypto-asset that represents a unique token. Crypto-assets are digital assets that utilize technologies such as peer-to-peer networks, cryptography, and rely on a public ledger to execute transactions. <a href="https://www.feedough.com/what-is-a-cryptoasset-types-of-cryptoassets-ultimate-guide/">Crypto-assets</a> include cryptocurrencies, platform tokens, NFTs, and many other forms of tokens that utilize these technologies. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full"><img src="https://filebase.com/blog/content/images/2022/02/nft-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="What are NFTs and Why Are They So Popular?"></figure><p>NFTs can take the form of any digital asset. The most popular NFTs right now are digital works of art, though NFTs can be videos, audio files, or pieces of writing.</p><p>Fungible assets are all the same and interchangeable. Think of a dollar bill or a bitcoin. Each dollar bill is worth the exact same and each bitcoin is worth the exact same. </p><p>In contrast, each <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/plp-what-is-nft?utm_source=google_search_nb&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=14578273644&amp;utm_content=125317688365&amp;utm_term=what%20are%20nfts&amp;utm_creative=567434657176&amp;cb_device=c&amp;cb_placement=&amp;cb_country=us&amp;cb_city=open&amp;cb_language=en_us&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA2sqOBhCGARIsAPuPK0gp9JqEMEwI_pibDjz6CUpYgW6xbn53wIuue5YgXu054U95xtsgZFoaAn3lEALw_wcB#what-does-non-fungible-mean">NFT is unique in appearance and value</a>. NFTs are not interchangeable with one another due to their unique nature. Think of them similar to concert tickets. While each ticket might be the same price, they are not interchangeable since each ticket represents a unique seat in the venue at a specific date and time for each different live show. </p><h2 id="can-you-make-your-own-nfts">Can You Make Your Own NFTs?</h2><p>Many artists and content creators create their own NFTs then list them for sale on NFT marketplaces such as <a href="https://opensea.io/collections">OpenSea</a>, <a href="https://rarible.com/explore/all">Rarible</a>, or <a href="https://solana.com/">Solana</a>. NFTs can be as simple as 8-bit illustrations of dogs or photographs you’ve taken, and can be as complex as 3D virtual world maps. </p><p>Some creators are curating ‘collections’ of NFTs where each NFT includes a character or image that is part of the collection’s theme. One project collection that is skyrocketing in value is the Bored Ape Yacht Club, which began to skyrocket after <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bored-ape-mutant-ape-yacht-club-nft-sales-skyrocket-floor-prices-spike-more-than-40/">Eminem tweeted that he bought an NFT from this collection for $452,000. </a></p><p>The process of making an NFT and listing it on a marketplace is known as 'minting'. </p><p>'Minting' in the most basic form refers to creating anything on a blockchain network. Minting is not NFT specific, though listing an NFT for sale on a marketplace such as OpenSea or Rarible qualifies as minting.  When you upload an NFT to a marketplace, it creates the NFT along with what is known as a Smart Contract on the chosen blockchain network.</p><p>A <a href="https://web3.hashnode.com/how-to-mint-an-nft-a-step-by-step-guide-to-creating-your-first-nft#heading-how-do-they-work">Smart Contract</a> is a program that is stored and executed on the blockchain. It contains the NFT's metadata, such as the name of the NFT, a URL to the NFT data file, a description of the NFT, and any other data the creator has included. If the NFT is part of a collection, sometimes there will be metadata stating it's position in the collection and its rarity compared to other NFTs in the collection. </p><p>When a creator uploads an NFT through a marketplace's web interface like OpenSea, they fill out a variety of fields with information about the NFT. On the backend, OpenSea creates the Smart Contract that stores the NFT's metadata.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://filebase.com/blog/content/images/2022/02/image-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="What are NFTs and Why Are They So Popular?" srcset="https://filebase.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/image-1.png 600w, https://filebase.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2022/02/image-1.png 1000w, https://filebase.com/blog/content/images/2022/02/image-1.png 1349w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards">OpenSea</a></figcaption></figure><p>Smart Contracts can be created as files and sent to a blockchain network without using a marketplace's web interface. By using this method, the creation of NFTs to be automated within a trustless system. If an NFT collection has 10,000 pieces in it, it would take the developer team a long time to manually upload and input the metadata to a marketplace such as OpenSea through their web interface. By creating Smart Contracts as files, humans can be removed from the minting process and a program can do the leg work. </p><h2 id="storing-nfts">Storing NFTs</h2><p>If you decide to make your own NFTs, where do you store them and their associated metadata?</p><p>The most secure and efficient option is to store your NFT collection and its data is on a decentralized cloud. Decentralized cloud storage, such as Filebase, is not only secure but durable. With attributes such as geo-redundancy, and security through erasure coding, Filebase is highly resilient against outages. Other cloud providers that use a traditional centralized infrastructure like AWS, are prone to outages, like the <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/what-happened-with-the-aws-outage">AWS US-EAST-1 outage</a> in December 2021. This outage brought thousands of businesses down for multiple hours, disturbing company's revenue and interrupting customer's days. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://filebase.com/blog/content/images/2022/02/CEvsDE.png" class="kg-image" alt="What are NFTs and Why Are They So Popular?" srcset="https://filebase.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/CEvsDE.png 600w, https://filebase.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2022/02/CEvsDE.png 1000w, https://filebase.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2022/02/CEvsDE.png 1600w, https://filebase.com/blog/content/images/2022/02/CEvsDE.png 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>By utilizing a decentralized cloud to store your NFT collection, you can rest assured that your NFTs are always accessible to the user's who want to buy, sell, and trade them, as they won't be susceptible to outages like the one Amazon faced. Users on the Filebase platform thankfully do not need to worry about <a href="https://filebase.com/blog/what-happens-when-my-cloud-goes-down/">"What Happens When My Cloud Goes Down?"</a>.</p><h2 id="what-makes-nfts-so-popular">What makes NFTs so popular?</h2><p>NFTs began to gain publicity and popularity last February when an artist named Beeple sold a 10 second video for <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/retail-trading-nfts/insight-how-a-10-second-video-clip-sold-for-6-6-million-idUKL8N2KV6X9">$6.6 million dollars.</a> Shortly after, a Wisconsin based artist sold a collage of 5,000 digital pieces of art at auction for <a href="https://www.cnn.com/style/article/beeple-first-nft-artwork-at-auction-sale-result/index.html">$69 million dollars</a>. </p><p>Each NFT comes with a unique token. These tokens are similar to when pieces of art or collectibles have a certificate of authenticity - it proves that the NFT is authentic and original. These tokens can be used as authentication keys, similar to API access and secret keys. NFTs are currently being used for things like virtual NBA trading cards, accessing original pieces of art and memes, or even for buying <a href="https://www.business2community.com/business-innovation/decentraland-a-virtual-world-created-by-nfts-02436224#:~:text=Decentraland%20is%20made%20of%20NFTs,NFTs%20or%20Non%2DFungible%20Tokens.&amp;text=NFT%20is%20a%20packet%20of,sold%2C%20traded%2C%20or%20bartered.">virtual real estate in the Decentraland</a>.</p><p>While some NFTs are gaining popularity purely on appearance and collectability, a variety of brands and companies such as <a href="https://marker.medium.com/why-taco-bell-charmin-and-pizza-hut-are-trying-to-sell-you-nfts-99a3a4cfc2f3">Taco Bell and Pizza Hut</a> are announcing plans to utilize NFTs for things such as promotional deals that include free products or content. </p><p>NFTs don’t have to be a part of a collection or have additional perks and benefits such as metaverse content and usability. These benefits often help drive the price of NFTs though, since an NFT with more features than just digital art make it more valuable to NFT collectors. Some NFT collections, such as NBA trading cards, have collector’s value that don’t rely on additional perks that allow the value to increase purely based on the trading value of the NFTs.</p><p>If you got an NFT for Christmas, you’re probably wondering what you should do with it. Depending on what collection the NFT is part of, you might be able to utilize it as a token in the creator’s metaverse or receive exclusive content and products from companies based on the NFT you purchase.
