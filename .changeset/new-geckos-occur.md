The host explorer now has an interactive map. Filtered hosts can be selected via the list or map, and hosts on the map are colored based on whether renterd is actively contracting with the host. For hosts with active contracts the size of the hosts on the map is based on renterd's used storage, for hosts without active contracts the size is based on the hosts remaining storage.
