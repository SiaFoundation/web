Nebulous today has raised $750,000 for Sia, led by [Procyon Ventures](http://www.procyonventures.com/) and [Raptor Group](http://www.raptorgroup.com/), with participation from [Fenbushi Capital](https://www.fenbushicapital.vc/index_en.html) and angel investor Xiaolai Li. To date, Nebulous has raised $1.25M in total funding. Sia achieved its 1.0 release in June of this year and the funding will allow the team to accelerate its development and further its use by enterprises.

Sia is a collaborative data storage platform which allows users to store and retrieve large amounts of data quickly and securely. Smart contracts allow users to seamlessly acquire storage from hosts all over the world which have agreed to rent space on their hard drives. Sia’s blockchain-based technology ensure hosts aren’t able to see inside the data they store while guaranteeing the data is available when needed. By creating a marketplace where thousands of hosts bid on a storage contract, this allows the platform to be more reliable and also deliver significant cost savings compared to traditional cloud providers.

"By using encryption, cryptographic contracts, and redundancy, Sia enables a collection of untrusted and unknown machines to be combined into a single logical cloud storage host that is faster, cheaper, and more reliable than traditional cloud storage platforms." David Vorick, cofounder and CEO, said.

Since inception in 2014, Sia’s focus has always been on bringing strong, fully decentralized cloud storage to the world. The first fully decentralized prototype of Sia launched in June 2015, a cloud storage platform that allowed both hosts and renters to participate in a network that had no centralized services or single points of failure. The following year was spent iterating on the tech, focusing on scalability and on an easy-to-use third party API. June 2016 saw the release of the completed API, along with a compatibility promise that all programs and services built using the 1.0.0 API would continue to work with all future versions of Sia.

With its 1.0 release, Sia became the first full-decentralized marketplace for cloud storage to move into production. Moving forward, the company’s primary focus will be on growing the developer community and beginning expansion into the enterprise market. Storage device maker Minebox has announced their forthcoming Minebox NAS will integrate with the platform to allow users to take full advantage of Sia for both storing data as well as renting space onto the network.

"Every team that works with data in a meaningful way, from AI to precision medicine to Industrial IoT, is seeing an explosion in the size of the datasets they want to be able to work with. Sia has the potential to be a game changer for them by fundamentally changing how data is captured, stored, and distributed." said Procyon partner Drew Volpe.

"We are impressed by Sia's distributed cloud storage platform, the community of engaged users, and see an opportunity for Sia to disrupt centralized cloud storage providers with improved security and rationalized storage expense." said Raptor Associate Director Joshua Langsam.
